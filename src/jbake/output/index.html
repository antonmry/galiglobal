The process is straightforward and it can be easily explained. Even if you don't have advanced knowledge of Weblogic or Linux, it's possible to do it. So, as we can see in this article, OCSG is very easy to install now and it has a lot of features deployed out-of-the-box. Because it's a so extensive application supporting a huge number of business possibilities (Service API Exposure, Direct Carrier Billing, Policy Gateway, etc. ), a basic fresh installation is a very powerful way to focus in the functionality and forget problems with databases, OS and other technical questions and now we can have it in only 15 minutes!</p></p>
  	
		<a href="blog/2015/We-are-TADHack-2015-winners.html"><h1>We are TADHack 2015 winners :-)</h1></a>
		<p>31 July 2015</p>
		<p><p>Without any type of doubt, <a href="http://www.tadhack.com">TADHack</a> is my favourite event in the year. Mainly because of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Excellent collaborative atmosphere and lots of friends. I love to have the opportunity to share some time with people involved in the same topics I'm working with. And not only that, it's full of techies :-)</li>
  <li>Event is well managed by Alan Quayle and his team. Everything goes smoothly and you are always busy speaking, developing, visiting other vendors or watching other hacks.</li>
  <li>It's not too big, so you have the chance to have a chat with almost everybody... this seems weird but when I'm participating in bigger events, I've the feeling I don't have time enough to speak with all people I would like to speak with. That doesn't happen in TADHack.</li>
</ul><p>My participation in this event is mainly because we are running and providing support for the Oracle Comms environment, there is a web with information about all the resources in case you are interested: <a href="http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com">http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com</a>. Even if it's the second year we are doing it, the installation of the three Oracle SDP products it's not straightforward. We had to update to the last versions of the products and we are always looking for ways to improve it. It's not a secret we are using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/">Amazon Web Services</a> to support this infrastructure. Some day I have to write a post about the whole infrastructure and how we are using AWS to support the service. The part about how we upload the VMs to AWS EC2 is quite awesome and tricky because some of them are based in customized Linux versions.</p><p>One of the most interesting things this year was the opportunity to participate as developers. Obviously we cannot be winners of the Oracle prize, it wouldn't be fair, but we can combine the Oracle environment with other sponsors, in this case we chose Intel providing an embedded board. Also we have a new member in the NetApps team, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathrodriguez">Jonathan</a>, who is a great Java and Android developer. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgYdT9Q7OWw">Here</a> it's the video where he's showing the hack in Lisbon:</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgYdT9Q7OWw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>And now the big news... we won!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Heart Rate Monitor team, winners of <a href="https://twitter.com/Inteliot">@Inteliot</a> prize at <a href="https://twitter.com/TADHack">@TADHack</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/antonmry">@antonmry</a> <a href="http://t.co/iPbWtemQ25">pic.twitter.com/iPbWtemQ25</a></p>&mdash; Alan Quayle (@Alan_Quayle) <a href="https://twitter.com/Alan_Quayle/status/610618140918157313">June 16, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>You can see my big smile in the photo. I'm more than happy being one of the winners. I guess I always have been a bit jealous of the others developers :-)</p><p>In short, TADHack 2015 has been great and bigger than the 2014 edition. The TAD ecosystem is evolving very quick and I'm really excited to see how this evolves in the following years.</p></p>
  	
		<a href="blog/2015/A-look-back-to-Geecon-2015.html"><h1>A look back to Geecon 2015</h1></a>
		<p>30 June 2015</p>
		<p><p>I've been invited by Oracle Comms to join <a href="http://2015.geecon.org/speakers/info.html?id=70">Geecon 2015</a> to speak about Web Real Time Commutations – Voice, Video, and Data Communications with my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait">Douglas Tait</a>. It's always a pleasure to work with someone as Doug and his feedback about previous editions was really good, so I was more than happy to participate in this event.</p><p>When I joined the event, I quickly realized Doug was right. There are all things you can expect from a developer event but mixed with a lot of fun things. Everybody is really friendly, organizers made a huge effort to make everybody feel really well. There are a lot of jokes. I really like the speakers hats, even if my head is too big for them, I know, it's my fault ;-)</p><p>One of the things I was more impressed with it's the place itself. It's a commercial cinema in Krakow. So everyday when the event ends, movies start. It's awesome. The place is perfect for conferences: great sound, great screen, comfortable chairs, etc. At the same time, it should be easy to book it, most of the cinemas are empty now, at least in Spain. It's a great idea and a good example of how Geecon organizers are able to think out of the box.</p><p>The other thing I really enjoyed it was the attendees. They were very participative, making good questions, proposing new ideas. In one of the conferences, even helped the speaker with some IntelliJ Idea shortcuts, really cool! With our talk it wasn't different, they made a lot of questions and we finished speaking with a lot of them. For something so specific as WebRTC and communications, it was great to see some people really interested on it. I have been always jealous of the Java ecosystem in relation to the TAD ecosystem, even with the great help of TADHack, there is a big gap yet.</p><p>Our talk was about how Java helps in communications, with focus on WebRTC, SIP and Telecom APIs. People was more interested in WebRTC than any other subject. We run some demos, show some code and made some jokes. <a href="https://vimeo.com/131761796">Here</a> it's the video recorded by the Geecon organizers:</p><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/131761796" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/131761796">GeeCON 2015: Ant&oacute;n Yuste, Douglas Tait - Web Real Time Commutations &ndash; Voice, Video, and Data Communications</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/geecon">GeeCON Conference</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p><p>I really would like to repeat next year. This is one of the best events where I had the opportunity to participate.</p></p>

		<a href="blog/2015/The-Oracle-ACE-Associate-award.html"><h1>The Oracle ACE Associate award</h1></a>
		<p>16 June 2015</p>
		<p><p>In the beginning of the year, I've been awarded as <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=19297:4:::NO:4:P4_ID:12240">Oracle ACE Associate</a>. It was the first time I've earned something like that so I'm very proud and happy. It's not a secret I've been working with Oracle Comms since 2007 but it wasn't until last year I started to be more active in social networks, writing articles and attending conferences. I should have started to do it sooner but it's not so easy, and it isn't until now I really know my desired professional path.</p><p><img src="/images/About-me/O_ACE_Icon_blk.png" alt="Oracle ACE Associate""/> </p><p>Let me explain the different reasons because this award is important to me.</p><h2>Optare Solutions</h2><p>Optare is a great company full of potential ACEs. I remember RittmanMead (a similar company in the BI space) and how <a href="http://www.rittmanmead.com/2014/12/six-months-an-ace/">they promote their workers to became Oracle ACE and participate in technical conferences</a>. I know how important is this type of activities. Things like that provide a more clear professional path, increase the visibility of the company (hey! They have 5 Orace ACE and 1 Oracle ACE Director) and, even more important, it helps to identify and retain talented people. I am the first Oracle ACE Associate in Optare. I hope this is only the beginning. There are really good Oracle consultants and developers in the company, so the most important thing (the know-how) is not going to be the problem. </p><h2>Oracle Communications</h2><p>Even if Oracle Comms is quite big after the adquisitions of ACME and Tekelec, the OTN community is quite inactive. For example, the last OTN article published <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/communications/index.html">here</a> it was in 2005, and not, the solution isn't close the section!. I would like to see a more active community and that was the reason of my Oracle ACE Associate submission. I know it's a big task and it's impossible to achieve it alone but there are some people inside Oracle working in this direction and I am quite positive. A probe of that is the <a href="http://www.tadhack.com">TADHack</a> and the <a href="http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/">Oracle Sandbox</a> promoted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait">Douglas Tait</a>, he's doing a great job building a developers community. I am sure we'll see important updates in the following months.</p><h2>Myself</h2><p>Everyone likes to receive awards and I am not different. But more important, it's a good sign about how I am doing things right now. In the end of 2012, I left Accenture and my work as Project Manager. I returned to Optare Solutions and it's a decision I don't regret. But I've to paid the fee: stop my career as manager and back to be a technical guy. Being an IT worker in Spain is never more a professional suicide. There are some cool companies as Optare Solutions and Quobis, or you can work remotely for foreign companies. All you have to do is to be a good engineer and speak English well. That's the reason because Oracle ACE Associate is important to me: it probes both.</p><p>Other important point, Oracle ACE Associate gives me access to some cool resources and the possibility to speak in technical conferences. I really appreciate that right now. And, of course, I have some cool Oracle stuff now :-)</p>

		<p>11 June 2015</p>
		<p><p>Tomorrow I will be travelling to <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/">TADHack</a> in Lisbon and I am so excited! It's going to be great! As part of the initiatives we've done to promote <a href="http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/">the Oracle sandbox</a> and help the developers, I've recorded three videos to introduce the three Oracle SDP applications. Even if they are oriented to the TADHack, they are a good resource for anyone interested in the products.</p><h2>Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller</h2><p>In this video, we are going to introduce Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller and how to use it to add audio, video and data communications to web and mobile applications. It provides an introduction to a sample application, a good starting point to develop more complex services. It ends explaining how to add a widget which allows developers to add Real-time communication in a very easy way.</p><p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKjHRvGVlXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Youtube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKjHRvGVlXQ">Using WebRTC services with OCWSC </a></p><h2>Oracle Communications Service Gatekeeper</h2><p>In this video, we are going to introduce the Telecom APIs available in the Oracle Communications sandbox: Messaging, Payment and Location. Developers will learn how to start to work with those APIs and how to add them to their own applications and hacks.</p><p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUqd0d2f8uQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Youtube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUqd0d2f8uQ">Telecom APIs with OCSG </a></p><h2>Oracle Communications Converged Application Server</h2><p>In this video, we are going to introduce Oracle Communications Converged Application Server and how to design and build applications able to manage HTTP and SIP protocols at the same time. We'll review also the new SIP Servlet 2.0 specification and the JSR-359 recently approved. We'll end the video reviewing a B2BUA application and learning to modify it to build more complex applications.</p><p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9IqHiAcNl4k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Youtube link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IqHiAcNl4k">Developing SIP Applications with OCCAS</a></p></p>
  	
		<a href="blog/2015/Summary-of-the-last-news-in-the-Oracle-Communications-Service-Delivery-Platform.html"><h1>Summary of the last news in the Oracle Communications Service Delivery Platform</h1></a>
		<p>21 May 2015</p>
		<p><p>When I've started this blog, my main motivation was to provide a central place with information about Service Delivery Platforms, mainly related to the Oracle Communication suite because it's what I know. But I am failing in this goal. I am very busy from the beginning of the year and I don't find time enough to write posts and articles. Excuses. I should keep in mind the original idea and don't miss the opportunity to keep readers updated with the last news.</p><p>So, this post is going to be a summary of the releases and news in the Oracle Comms SDP.... and there are a lot!.

As usual, great work from Leif.</p><h1>Oracle Communications Evolved Communications Application Server (aka eCAS)</h1><p>The most important news for the end: a new product based in OCCAS. Here the note:</p>
<blockquote><p>As mobile operators drive their networks toward an all-IP and virtualized state, they require the means to design and deliver compelling high definition voice, video and multimedia offers via Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Oracle Communications Evolved Communications Application Server (OCECAS) brings a sophisticated, yet easy-to-use network service design and delivery product to satisfy that need. OCECAS works out of the box; it is NFV-enabled and standards compliant; and it provides network-grade speed and reliability with the cost profile of an IT product. </p><p>Beyond service delivery, OCECAS accelerates the operator's move to better network cost performance by driving subscribers to offers that engage IP assets, allowing the operator to retire more traditional components. This drive toward the single IP network also facilitates spectrum reuse for increased monetization opportunity. OCECAS is a significant step forward in the journey to the all-IP, virtualized network destination. </p><p>Operators will also enjoy lower service update costs as the flexible user interface allows service changes to be implemented without costly, time-consuming software coding or vendor customizations.</p><p>The Oracle Communications Evolved Communications Application Server includes:</p><p>** Key Capabilities **<br/>- Out of the box VoLTE and VoWiFi application designed for GSMA standards for immediate productivity<br/>- Built from the ground up to support NFV<br/>- Standards-compliant IMS interfaces built with SIP, Diameter and Java<br/>- Easy to use, yet powerful session design center providing intuitive drag and drop application configuration<br/>- Continuous design-time validation enforcement and version control to ensure quality<br/>- Automated deployment across testing, staging and production environments<br/>- Flexible data federation across multiple sources to prevent costly custom integrations<br/>- Productized integration with Oracle Communications Core Session Manager (OCCSM)<br/>- Runtime powered by the Oracle Communications Converged Application Server (OCCAS) 7.0<br/>- Interoperability testing underway with Radisys and Dialogic Media Resource Functions<br/>- Integration of inbound third-party services, enabling differentiated offers</p><p>** Benefits **<br/>- Productive from the first day<br/>- Delivers true service agility for improved time to market<br/>- Enables attractive, differentiated offer creation<br/>- Freedom from vendor-specific customizations<br/>- Virtualized, interoperable, standards-compliant<br/>- Robust, network-grade operation on industry-standard platforms<br/>- Low TCO</p>

Being OCCAS based, it's very easy for us to learn the new product and there are some interesting integration with ACME products. I will build a laboratory very soon and I hope to find time to write more about this new product.</p><p>Stay tunned!</p></p>
  	
		<a href="blog/2015/SpringIO-2015-a-great-event-for-a-great-community.html"><h1>SpringIO 2015: a great event for a great community</h1></a>
		<p>14 May 2015</p>
		<p><p>I had the opportunity to participate in <a href="http://www.springio.net/using-groovy-to-empower-webrtc-network-systems/">SpringIO as speaker</a> in April (Barcelona). It was quite scary to participate in a conference about Spring, I am not a web developer, and, in fact, when I have to develop or design any web system based in Java, I prefer just to use EJB3 and Servlet 3.2, avoiding any framework. But there is something more in this conference: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_%28programming_language%29">Groovy</a>. And we are using Groovy in a lot of cool things, specially in the WebRTC domain. So the idea was simple: introduce WebRTC and show an interesting Groovy use case.</p><p>Unfortunately, Groovy is not in a good moment right now. Yes, there are a lot of people speaking about it... but after Strachan (Groovy's creator) wrote on his blog, "I can honestly say if someone had shown me the Programming in Scala book by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon &amp; Bill Venners back in 2003 I'd probably have never created Groovy." and Pivotal is not hosting the project any more... well, uncertain future for Groovy... and it's a pity. Because sometimes we need a scripting language and Groovy is a great choice if you are a Java developer, as I am. It's dynamically compiled to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode, so the performance is good, even for network system. Also it can interoperate with other Java code and libraries.</p><p>For all these reasons, I would like to see Oracle more involved in the Groovy project, for instance reviving the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=241">JSR-241</a> and ending with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython">jython</a>... If you are working with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E29542_01/nav/wlst.htm">Weblogic Scripting Tool (WLST)</a>, you probably hate Jython as much I do. Other important point is <a href="https://gradle.org/">gradle</a>, it looks a great tool even if I didn't have opportunity to test it yet. Anyway, I am quite happy with Maven, specially now with the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/entry/weblogic_server_and_the_oracle">new Maven Oracle Repository</a>. And I have also <a href="https://code.google.com/p/spock/">Spock</a> in the "thing to review" list, a testing framework also based in Groovy. </p><p>Even if my talk wasn't successful and my interest in the Spring framework is limited, I've really enjoyed the event. First, because it was very well organized. Second, the quality of the speakers was awesome, the technical quality of some talks was superb. And not only because of the speakers, also because of the audience. I envy Spring having a so good community, it would we so great to have something similar with Telecom Application Developers. That's one of the reasons because I'm so excited with the <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/">TADHack</a> and all the work <a href="http://alanquayle.com">Alan Quayle</a> is doing. It is a long road yet but a good start. </p><p>Here my slides. I've covered WebRTC, then Groovy and I've finished with some TADHack references.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/bKBppeBAK8rQze" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><p>There is also a project in GitHub with the source code if you are interested: <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/SpringIOWebRTCSampleApp">SpringIOWebRTCSampleApp</a>.</p></p>

		<a href="blog/2015/Oracle-s-demos-in-the-MWC2015-review.html"><h1>Oracle's demos in the MWC2015 review</h1></a>
		<p>15 April 2015</p>
		<p><p>This March has been crazy. Starting with the Mobile World Congress and next week flying to Brazil for three weeks because of an Oracle Comms project... Impossible to find time to tweet, blog or whatever, and it's a pity because there a lot of news!</p><p>Let me start from the beginning: the Mobile World Congress. I always like to assist to this event. Everybody is there, so it's very tired but also very productive. I've participated in more than 20 meetings, some conferences, the amazing <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WebRTC-Barcelona/">WebRTC Meetup</a> organized by our friends Quobis (don't miss the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-81k_pDU24">Stefano Gioia presentation</a>) and, this year for first time, I was able to find some time slot to see demos.</p><p>When I've arrived to the Oracle booth, I quickly noticed the key topic of this year: Network Function Virtualization (NFV). So, it's not strange most of the demos were related to this in some way. I've started with a demo using the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/diameter-signaling-router/index.html">Diameter Signaling Router</a>, a Tekelec product. The demo was mainly showing how they are able to add new nodes to increase the processing capacity dynamically. They defined it as NFV compliant and well.. I was a bit disappointed with this. For me, NFV is not to be able to add new nodes to a cluster system.. it's the capacity to increase the resources dynamically.... and always in the same way, a centralized way. And this should be the point. NFV shouldn't be virtualization, clustering or geographic-redundancy... they were invented some time ago. The other thing I didn't like: the solutions wasn't based in Coherence or even Weblogic... which it should be pointless when you are in an Oracle booth. Anyway, the product looks very interesting, robust and well-designed.. and the people in the booth were really professional and skilled with diameter.</p><p>I jumped to the next demo and I was very pleased to see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html">Services Gatekeeper</a> integrated with the Oracle Tekelec PCRF... very interesting use case. I've to try it but I don't know the Tekelec PCRF and it's not easy to find documentation about it (I mean, a simple how-to). There are good documentation in the OCSG side, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e55395/ipl_pcrf.htm#SGIPL700">Integrating Services Gatekeeper with a PCRF</a>, but it lacks the PCRF steps.</p><p>I continued with a huge demo involving <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html">Services Gatekeeper</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/unified-communications/converged-application-server-edition/overview/index.html">Converged Application Server</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/siebel/overview/index.html">Siebel</a>. The use case is very well designed: the subscriber can browse the Siebel front-end where he has a lot of information available and now, he has also an interface to watch movies (or whatever) in streaming.. something like Netflix but linked to the CSP account. The subscriber choose a movie to watch and he can choose between pay the total amount (using his billing account in the CSP) or save some money watching some advertisement sponsored by Service Providers/Third parties (very clever use of the OCSG PRM interface!). The demo is very visual and the <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveNorthridge">@SteveNorthridge</a> explanations very clear to understand the use case and possibilities. I am sure we'll speak a lot about this demo.</p><p>The next demo it's well know: the WebRTC Real state demo. I was in the event where it was showed the first time and I am never tired of it. Here it's the video, I am sure <a href="https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait">@Doug_Tait</a> explains it better than me :-)</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2CZxyR3ftw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>There was also a demo showing <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/unified-communications/overview/index.html">Oracle Communications Unified Communications Suite</a> enhanced with WebRTC capabilities. It makes sense combine <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html">WebRTC Session Controller</a> with different Oracle products, and UCS is the logical first step. In the <a href="https://wikis.oracle.com/display/CommSuite/Overview+of+Convergence+with+WebRTC">Oracle wiki</a> there a lot of good information about it.</p><p>I spend some time in the Analytics demo. It's not my area but the use case are pretty interesting, specially related to churn detection and some of the systems I work with are a good source of information. Furthermore the company where I work, Optare Solutions, is doing <a href="http://optaresolutions.com/innovacion/">some interesting things</a> related to this and the guy in the stand was really kind and skilled in the subject.</p><p>After that I jumped to the most interesting demo for me: the whole NFV solution. I didn't have luck this time because the main analyst (someone I had previous meeting with) was busy all the time and I didn't have the opportunity to have all my questions answered. Anyway, I found out some interesting points:<br/>* The solutions look good, very complete and mature, using a mix of Oracle technologies including virtualization, Oracle OSS (an old friend of mine, UIM) and Oracle ACME products. Oracle has a huge portfolio so it makes sense to use them instead of reinvent the wheel.<br/>* It's very flexible and powerful but it has a cost: it's complex because it involves some big products. Very good for carriers but no so good for small companies.<br/>* Openstack as cloud computing platform software but it's not mandatory, you can choose Oracle VM Server, for example.</p><p>And for me the most important point, Oracle is starting to include Network functions. And it's easy, because the Oracle technologies are based in Java / Weblogic and they have some interesting Network applications, as for example <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/unified-communications/converged-application-server-edition/overview/index.html">Oracle Communications Converged Application Server (OCCAS)</a> or the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/application-session-controller/index.html">Oracle Communications Application Session Controller</a>. I expect very interesting news in the next months related to this and it's going to be big, because this is something only Oracle can provide so easily, so a good competitive advantage over their competitors in the NFV area. Also don't miss [the demo with Intel](Oracle Communications Advances Network Function Virtualization by Delivering Carrier-Grade Data Center Performance) announced some days ago.</p><p>I ended the tour with a visit to Connected Vehicle demo. It's not related to any Oracle Comms product but I worked in a similar project some months ago and Oracle solutions are always interesting. The demo isn't very impressive but it's amazing how they are using Java to build it. I thought a lot on it and how to use it for other use cases. Here it's <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/internetofthings/java-iot-connected-vehicle-wp-2401533.pdf">the whitepaper with all the information about the Connected Vehicle</a>.</p><p>In short, MWC2015 was a great event and I am not going anymore to miss the opportunity to review a demo .</p></p>
  	
		<a href="blog/2015/Access-OCSG-EDR-JMS-Topic-with-Talend-Open-Studio.html"><h1>Access OCSG EDR JMS Topic with Talend Open Studio</h1></a>
		<p>13 February 2015</p>
		<p><p>I've been using <a href="https://www.talendforge.org/tutorials/tutorial.php?idTuto=14">Talend Open Studio</a> for a long time. It's an impressive software to do automated tasks, it works well and the development is quite fast. Furthermore, the TtHW (Time to Hello World) is really short. As you can see, I like it.</p><p>In this tutorial, I am going to show how to use it Talend Open Studio to access the JMS Topic where OCSG shows all the runtime information: the Event Data Records (EDRs). This is the main place for debugging so it's really important. The article is based in the offical documentation <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e50771/pds_edrlistener.htm#SGPDS627">Creating EDR Listeners</a> but adapted to TOS.</p><h2>Pre-requisites</h2><p>You will need an OCSG 6 or 5.1 running and also the <a href="http://www.talend.com/download/talend-open-studio?qt-product_tos_download=3#qt-product_tos_download">TOS Data Integration</a> installed in your computer.</p><h2>Talend Open Studio development</h2><p>Drop a tJMSInput component in the canvas and double click over it.</p><p><img src="/images/Access-OCSG-EDR-JMS-Topic-with-Talend-Open-Studio/tJMSInput.png" alt="tJMSInput component""/></p><p>Configure all the fields as you can see in the following picture:</p><p><img src="/images/Access-OCSG-EDR-JMS-Topic-with-Talend-Open-Studio/tJMSInput_form.png" alt="tJMSInput fields""/></p><p>Some important notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have to import the library <em>wlthint3client.jar</em> before to use the component. You can find it in <em><OCSG Installation folder>/wlserver/server/lib/wlthint3client.jar</em>. To import it, there are several ways, for instance, the tLibraryLoad component.</li>
  <li>Change the <strong>Server URL</strong> to your environment configuration. It must be a Node, not an Admin. In this case it's an standalone configuration with Admin and Node in the same Weblogic instance.</li>
  <li>Change the <strong>Message from</strong> to your environment configuration. If you don't know it, go to the Console,in the Domain Structure, <strong>Services -&gt; Messaging -&gt; JMS Servers</strong>.</li>
</ul><h2>Weblogic configuration</h2><p>There is a missing point, and it's the key. In the Weblogic console: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the Domain Structure and Select <strong>Services -&gt; Messaging -&gt; JMS-Modules</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click on <strong>WLNGJMSResource -&gt; EdrTopic -&gt; Advanced</strong>.</li>
  <li>Find <strong>Create Destination Identifier</strong> and introduce <em>com.bea.wlcp.wlng.edr.EdrTopic</em> and Save.</li>
  <li>Reboot the Weblogic.</li>
</ol><p><img src="/images/Access-OCSG-EDR-JMS-Topic-with-Talend-Open-Studio/WeblogicJMSConfiguration.png" alt="Weblogic JMS Configuration""/></p><p>This step is mandatory because of the tJMSInput component but it can be avoided if you are accessing the JMS Topic in another way.</p><h2>The end</h2><p>That's all. Click on Run in the Talend Open Studio and you should be subscribed to the Topic. Send an SMS from the PTE and you should start to generate EDRs. The next step would be create the Java classes to access the EDR information and start to work with it.</p></p>
  	
		<a href="blog/2015/Ramblings-about-OCCAS-and-the-Oracle-Communications-roadmap.html"><h1>null</h1></a>
		<p>11 February 2015</p>
		<p><p>This is going to be a different type of post. I usually write about technical things but today I am going to try something different. Well, maybe not so different, I have more questions than answers, but at least, I will try to explain as I see the Oracle Comms portfolio and its evolution. Just for the record, I don't work inside Oracle, I don't have privileged information and if you do any business decision based in this article, you are a fool.</p><h2>Context</h2><p>In 2006, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/metasolv/index.html">Oracle acquired MetaSolv</a>, recognized leader in service fulfillment operations support system (OSS) solutions for next-generation communications service providers. Two years later, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/bea/index.html">Bea Systems... and with it, Weblogic Server</a>, the Application Server leader of the market. After that, Oracle has build a strong position in the OSS market, no only from a business perspective, also from a technical point of view. All the products are similar (from the CRM to the Inventory) and they share the same architectural principles. As consequence, CSPs enjoy some advantages. For example, after the first deployment, they have the knowledge and experience to continue deploying the rest of the suite. </p><p>In February 2013, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1903221">Oracle bought Acme Packet</a>, the leading global provider of session border control technology. One month later <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/tekelec/index.html">Oracle bought Tekelec</a>, a leading provider of network signaling, policy control, and subscriber data management solutions for communications networks. All the analysts saw this as a big movement to the Network market. Me too.</p><h2>Oracle Comms Converged Application Server</h2><p>Most of people didn't realize Oracle had a previous portfolio of Networks Applications before the acquisition. Even if this suite is no so big as the OSS and BSS suites, it has importance and business share inside the firm... and something more important, a very intelligent roadmap based in OCCAS as network platform for everything. But.... what is OCCAS? The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/unified-communications/converged-application-server-edition/overview/index.html">Oracle Communications Converged Application Server</a> is a Weblogic with Telecom Network capabilities (mainly SIP and Diameter) and oriented to real-time applications. As product, it's very small. It's not easy to find a CSP asking for it, because the business case is not so clear. OCCAS is more like a Framework, something you are going to use to develop other things. And, in fact, most of the SDP portfolio is based in OCCAS, for instance, OCSG and the Unified Communications suite. </p><p>The Converged Application Server <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E27702_01/doc.51/e27705/tpd_developing.htm#autoId1">Service Creation Environment</a> (SCE) consists of a faceted framework that supplements the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html">Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse</a> (OEPE). The SCE provides tools and resources you can use to develop converged applications, including wizards, simulators, and templates. And also it provides the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E27702_01/doc.51/e27707/sip_sft_overview.htm">Service Foundation Toolkit</a> (SFT), a converged application Java development framework. It provides APIs that abstract the details of the communication protocol for the application, enabling to focus on the service value provided by converged SIP and HTTP applications. The idea is simple: if you are a developer with Java and Eclipse knowledge, you can start to develop Telecom applications without knowledge about Telecom protocols. And those applications will run in the leader platform: Weblogic. So they will be carrier-grade with all the performance, security and scalability requirements.</p><p><img src="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E27702_01/doc.51/e27705/img/sce_overview.gif" alt="The Converged Application Server Service Creation Environment""/></p><h2>Oracle Comms Roadmap</h2><p>A roadmap with all the Network products based in OCCAS makes sense for several reasons. Some of them are:<br/>* <strong>Contrasted technologies</strong>: Java, Weblogic, the Oracle Database, Linux, Eclipse and so on. You are not reinventing the wheel. All those technologies are familiar to the CSPs, they trust them.<br/>* <strong>Cloud and virtualization</strong>: CSPs want to be ready for the near future. They know about the advantages of virtualization and cloud strategies. And OCCAS is the perfect choice for that. You can run it in several platforms, deploy it, scale it and so on. It's flexible and modern.<br/>* <strong>Learn one, use many</strong>: you start deploying one application, and after that, you will have the knowledge and resources to deploy the rest of the suite (if you want). You will save a lot of time learning complex systems or technologies so you will be more flexible and faster delivering new products to the market.<br/>* <strong>Easy support</strong>: the Operation team needs to know about basic technologies: no more, no less. As you need a DBA, you will need a Weblogic expert who can work with all the systems. In short, the daily support will be easier because the level of complexity is smaller.<br/>* <strong>Maintenance and upgrade</strong>: all the products are going to do it in the same way and it's out-of-the-box in Weblogic. Converged Applications Server's upgrade feature ensures that no calls are dropped while during the upgrade of a production application. The upgrade process also enables you to revert or rollback the process of upgrading an application. If, for example, you determine that there is a problem with the newer version of the deployed application, you can undeploy the newer version and activate the older version.<br/>* <strong>High availability and geographic redundancy</strong>: it's provided out-of-the-box, so you don't need worry about that.<br/>* <strong>The BSS/OSS suite</strong>: it's based on the same technologies. Any CSP with some of those products installed has the experience and knowledge to start to work with OCCAS or any OCCAS-based product and the integration between BSS/OSS and Network would be easier.</p><p>As we saw before in the OSS suite, this is a winner strategy. And it doesn't end here. After have everything running in the same platform, Oracle can start to work in the integration between the products, something like the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/application-integration-architecture/overview/index.html">Oracle Application Integration Architecture (AIA)</a> but oriented to the network. Any network vendor in the market can compete with something like that.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>The final question: is Oracle going to migrate the ACME and Tekelec products to the OCCAS platform?. We know the advantages but there are also problems. Migrate part of the portfolio to this platform requires a lot of resources and it's very time-consuming. And of course, not all the products are valid (specific hardware systems doesn't have sense in OCCAS) or they are not going to have enough Return of Investment. So, I don't have an answer for that. After two years, I didn't see movements in this direction but I also know the acquisitions take a lot of time and it's soon yet. Oracle did a great job combining OCCAS and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50379_01/index.htm">Application Session Controller</a> (ASC) to launch the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html">WebRTC Session Controller</a> (WSC). That is for sure <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/COMMSINFODEV/entry/new_tech_new_challenges_the">the path to follow</a> but they are just two products running independently and integrated using a REST interface and we are speaking about have the ASC capabilities running on OCCAS. </p><p>On the other hand, Oracle has announced recently the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/2418407">Oracle Communications Network Service Orchestration Solution</a>. This is the mainly Oracle NFV bet but it doesn't look based in OCCAS or even Weblogic. And we know, Oracle can buy some specific NFV/SDN company, they don't need to develop their own solution... but with more acquisitions the path to have only one platform will be even more complicated.</p><p>This year we probably will see a new version release of OCCAS. That will be the moment to know about the future of this excellent platform. </p></p>

</blockquote><p>It's soon yet to write a detailed analysis but I would like to highlight some takeaways. This is not the typical release.. in fact, there isn't an official announcement as we've seen previously. There are a lot of small improvements to help operators and system integrators to work with OCSG which it's great. Some of them:</p>
<ol>
  <li>** <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e54151/toc.htm">New Default Single-system Installation Option and Getting Started Guide</a>:** everything in a single package (database included), it's going to save us a lot of time and PoCs will be easier. Great point.</li>
  <li>** <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/index.htm">Documentation Improvements</a>:** I've to check them yet but the new structure looks better and, for sure, some sections in the 5.1 documentation could be improved/corrected.</li>
  <li>** <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e55395/ipl_pcrf.htm#SGIPL700">PCRF Integration Example</a>:** This is something I really appreciate because I was working on that and it's really hard because of the lack of information and references to the Tekelec product. I will do it very soon but after a first look, it lacks a bit more of detail in the Tekelec PCRF setup.</li>
  <li>** <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e50764/prm_intro.htm#SGPRM106">Extending the Portal User Interfaces and Portal Developer's Guide</a>: ** I know there are a lot of improvements in this part. An easier installation and customization, for sure, one of the points everybody asked with the previous version.</li>
  <li>** <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e54898/toc.htm">New API Management Features</a>: ** OCSG competes some times (but not always) with more general products as API gateways. Improvements in this part are warmly welcomed.</li>
</ol><p>I miss some things as more Geographic redundancy improvements and more debugging options but it's soon yet to know if they're or not in this release. Anyway, there are more interesting improvements, consult the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e50775/toc.htm">Release Note</a> for detailed information.</p><p>I will try to write some specific articles showing the new features. Just <a href="http://www.serviceandnetworkevolution.com/">subscribe to the blog</a> to keep yourself informed.</p></p>

		<p><p>Deal with java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space errors is always tricky. Most of the times it's something related to the chosen JVM, probably not supported for the hosting OS (for example, using a 32bits JVM in a 64bits OS is a typical issue).</p><p>Here I provide two interesting ways to check the JVM configuration:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/antonmry/efe307a587388c3ecdfb.js"></script><p>For example, perhaps we could want to increase the PermSize, so we edit the &lt;Domain dir &gt;/ &lt;Server Name &gt;/bin/setDomainEnv.sh to add something like this in the beginning:</p>
<pre><code># USER_MEM_ARGS   - The variable to override the standard memory arguments
#                   passed to java.

USER_MEM_ARGS=&quot;-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:CompileThreshold=8000 -XX:PermSize=256m&quot;
export USER_MEM_ARGS
</code></pre><p>Now it's time to reboot the weblogic and check everything again using the same commands I showed previously.</p><p>More info:<br/>- <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs100/config_scripting/using_WLST.html#wp1093952">Invoking WLST</a><br/>- <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs100/config_scripting/monitoring.html">Getting Runtime Information</a><br/>- <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/practicalbpm/entry/wlst_scripting_to_get_weblogic">WLST Scripting Introduction</a></p></p>

		<p>17 November 2014</p>
		<p><p>I was invited recently to participate in the Pre-conference Oracle WebRTC Workshop of the <a href="http://tadsummit.com/2014/">TADSummit 2014</a> (Istanbul). I should speak about the implementation and architecture details of a WebRTC deployment in a Communication Service Provider. It was a real challenge, I had a lot of work in the previous weeks and I know about the excellent quality of the other speakers: <a href="https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait">Doug</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EPCarrera">Elias</a> from Quobis or Stephano Gioia (who made a highly recommended presentation about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gioste/webrtc-workshop-what-i">What is (and isn't WebRTC)</a> ).</p><p>Even without time and being a technical guy, I've tried to do something different, speaking about our experience in the TADHack 2014 (where we've deployed and supported the Oracle platform) and a combination of some previous experiences from the deployment in some LATAM operators.

		<a href="blog/2014/WebRTC-as-key-part-of-Service-Exposure.html"><h1>WebRTC as key part of Service Exposure</h1></a>
		<p>01 October 2014</p>
		<p><p>Some weeks ago, Oracle has proposed us to write an article about WebRTC to be published in its blog: <a href="http://blog.webrtc-solutions.com">http://blog.webrtc-solutions.com</a>. I was in charge of the main edition, with some colleges helping in the revision (thanks Sandra, Eva and Nacho!). It was a good time to review why WebRTC is so important to us. There are a lot of companies involved today with WebRTC, different sectors, different sizes and types as you can see in the <a href="http://www.cio2cmo.com/webrtc-landscape-infographic-june-2014/">The WebRTC Landscape Infographic</a> from Brad Bush.</p><p><img src="http://www.cio2cmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WebRTC-Landscape-Infographic-2014-06.png" alt="The WebRTC Landscape Infographic – June 2014""/></p><p>WebRTC is so exciting for us because very specific reasons... so I've developed our motivations in the article: as expert in telecom service exposure, WebRTC is the perfect choice to expose one of the main telecom assets: voice, and with less importance yet, video. In fact, I see WebRTC as a key part of the Service Delivery Platforms of the near future.</p><p>The article: <a href="http://blog.webrtc-solutions.com/webrtc-as-key-part-of-service-exposure/">WebRTC as key part of Service Exposure</a></p></p>

		<p><p>As part of the activities we did for the <a href="http://tadhack.com/2014/">TADHack 2014</a>, I've recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ap8OqgAHQQ&feature=autoshare">this short tutorial</a> about the Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper SDK:</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6ap8OqgAHQQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>This is a very interesting tool for developers, a lot of people asked us for it and Oracle allow us to distribute it between the TADHack participants... It can made a big different for a CSP trying to engage developers.</p><p>More information is available in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36135_01/doc.51/e37529/toc.htm">Oracle® Communications Services Gatekeeper SDK User's Guide Release 5.1</a></p></p>

		<p><p>In May 2014, Oracle propose us to deploy and manage its <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/service-network-evolution/index.html">SANE solution</a> for the <a href="http://tadhack.com/2014/">TADHack event</a> and support the developers community. With only a few weeks, it was a big challenge. I've participated as technical responsible and it was a great experience because it was a very different type of project: any operator was involved so we were free to choose the platform. Also the requirements were very different: the main goal was engage the developers.</p><p>This is the list of activities we did:<br/>1. Create <a href="http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/">a website</a> with all the information needed by the developers.<br/>2. Create a <a href="https://github.com/OTADHack">Github community</a> to provide source code samples, a ticketing system and so on.<br/>3. We've deployed <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html">Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html">Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller</a> in Amazon Web Services to give access to the developers.<br/>* We run some webinars, as for example this one with <a href="http://www.alanquayle.com/">Alan Quayle</a>, Oracle Comms and <a href="http://www.alerant.com/">Alerant</a>:</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0NXr68zvGrA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>It was a great experience and I hope to repeat the next year!.</p>
