I'm a Principal Software Engineer focused on **Event Streaming and Real-Time
Processing**. I've experience working with different message brokers and event
streaming platforms ([Apache Kafka], [Apache Pulsar], [Google Pub/Sub] and
[Azure EventHub]) and real-time processing frameworks ([Flink], [Kafka
Streams], [Spark Structured Streaming], [Google Dataflow], [Azure Stream
Analytics], etc.).

During my career, **I specialized in building internal SaaS** in big
corporations to make complex technologies easily used and adopted by teams so
they can build solutions to real business use cases. From the very beginning,
I can help with governance, operation, performance, adoption, training and any
task related to system administration or backend development.

I have a strong sense of my goals as Principal Software Engineer which are
very good summarized in [Some Thoughts on the Principal Role]:

- **Help people get better at what they do**.
- Be involved with architecture or other kinds of design, best practices,
  CI/CD, testing, or whatever is necessary.
- Make systems and global architectures technically better and more robust.
- Be expandable. The whole team should be independent and continue improving
  after I'm no longer with them.

## Tech Community

I also like to organize technology events, groups and other activities:

- [Streaming Annotated Newsletter]: receive the last news and interesting
  articles about streaming platforms and processing frameworks each month in
  your mailbox.
- [VigoJUG] co-organizer of the Vigo Java User Group since 2017.
- [Coru침aJUG] co-organizer of the Coru침a Java User Group since 2018.
- [LaretasGeek] is a virtual panel and podcast about technology with focus on
  Java.

Sometimes I speak at international [technology conferences] as Geecon, JBCNConf,
Greach, SpringIO, CommitConf, TADSummit, Atl치nticaConf, LicorcaConf, CoimbraJUG,
PosadaDev, etc.

I've received some awards during my career:

* 2020: [Confluent Community Catalyst].
* 2015: [TADHack Global Winner]
* 2015: [Oracle ACE Associate]
