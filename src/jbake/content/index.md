I have a passion for building high-throughput streaming systems and platforms
that solve the challenges that come with them.

I have a strong sense of my goals as Principal Software Engineer, summarized in

- [CoruñaJUG] co-organizer of the Coruña Java User Group since 2018.
- [LaretasGeek] is a virtual panel and podcast about technology with focus on
  Java (discontinued).
- [Streaming Annotated Newsletter]: the last news and interesting articles
  about streaming platforms and processing frameworks each month in your
  mailbox (discontinued).
