## What's a Principal Software Engineer?

One of the things I couldn't answer in the last 4-5 years it was my role.

Am I a manager? No. I may manage people from an organization point of view but
my way to manage is "don't manage at all" and let the team self organize with
my help. I tent to focus more in the team and processes and less in people
problems.

Am I a developer? Well, code is something I like to do but I spent a lot more
time helping others to code than coding myself. Even more important, because of
frequent interruptions, I don't enjoy too much coding new features. I prefer to
work in proof of concepts or refactoring because it isn't so problematic if I
have to stop and resume it later. I also spend more time doing coding review
than coding myself.

An architect? A big part of my work is to improve systems and platforms.
Listen problems and propose solutions. But I don't feel like the guy who do
a plan which must be blindly followed by others. I see design and architecture
as something more collaborative and myself as a facilitator. I usually share
my experience doing similar things in the past and I help to make people thing
out of the box, see their problems from a different perspective.

Am I a product manager? I work a lot with the roadmap and backlog of the
platforms where I'm more involved. Evangelize in the usage of the service is
very important. But this applies more for internal platforms. For public
services, it's just too much work and someone focused only on that is needed.

The list could continue: Systems Engineer, Support Engineer, DevOps, etc. Even
the term "Individual contributor" seems wrong. My contributions aren't
individual but for individuals. The reality of the role is to do whatever is
necessary to make teams and platforms succeed with freedom to choose the best
way to achieve it. A sort of technical "Jack of all trades, master of none".

One day I found this blog post in my timeline: [Some Thoughts on the Principal
Role]. Based in this article, it was clear to me:

- I prefer to help people instead of manage people.
- I like to be very involved in development but not necessarily code it myself,
  in special features which take more time and need more focus.
- I help with ideas, patterns and processes to build better systems but I don't
  tell anybody what has to do.

What a revelation! I'm a Principal Software Engineer. Not only that, it's what
I want to do in the long term, what makes me happy. It was great to know there
is a name for that and other people out there with the same motivations and
struggles. It's for that people, I would like to share my main challenges and
experiences in this role.

## No clear definition of the role: the management trap

Many organizations don't understand the role. They understand they need it but
not the role it-self. This tend to lead to the "we need people with strong
technical background to lead our teams" approach.

It's easier to fall in that trap. I think I'm joining the company as Principal
but I end working as Project Manager (or similar). I have experience as
Engineering Manager but even with that, things don't evolve well in this
situation. If I continue working as manager, I will slowly loose my technical
skills but the organization expects them so, in the long term, I won't meet
their expectations. If I focus more in the technical part, I will neglect
people I manage which it's the most important job of a manager. If, somehow,
I fight to keep both things it will end suffering job burnout. The article
[Maker's schedule, manager's schedule] is a great explanation about why both
things aren't compatible in the long term.

It isn't easy to solve this misalignment between the company and you. I usually
try to make alliances with other managers who want to be people managers so
I can focus in my role as engineer.  I also start to evangelize about the role
and how to implement it properly in the organization. Some of my tasks
(recruiting, DevRel, community) require a lot of communication with HR and it
helps to make them see the need of separated technical and people roles.

If after a while things don't evolve, a job change is the only alternative.
Most of organizations tend to listen when their engineers leave so it's a good
moment to help them to make this right.

## Relation with managers

As Principal, I usually don't make the final decision. This may be quite
frustrating when managers take decisions without taking you in account. It's
specially problematic when they decide technical things which have a huge
impact in the platform.

Build a good relation with engineering managers is very important to succeed in
the role. They should ask about architecture and processes. Principals should
train them to have knowledge to report and publish to the rest of the
organization what we are doing.

This is particularly complex with managers who have a good technical
background. Because they tent to try to manage people and systems, they are too
busy to listen. So they usually take shortcuts: decide now, explain to the team
later. It's hard to deal with this because it's an organization issue. Managers
should focus on people, engineers on systems. Processes should be the common
ground.

Another problem with managers is career evolution. If they see Principals as
competitors the relation can suffer. If they use their technical background as
a weapon to deal with politics, principals are a thread. I have seen very weird
executives meetings discussing deep technical things who nobody in the room
really understand. This is again, an organization problem. I deal with it
explaining from the very beginning I don't want their role. This seems to work
but it takes time to build that trustiness. Politics are hard and very harmful
for the organization.

## Don't be a hero

Another typical trap of the role it's become a hero. It may happen for many
reason, being the typical than it's easier to ask you about something than to
think about it. So other engineers may rely on you for tasks they don't like.

This isn't an issue when starting with a team but it's a huge problem in the
long term. If after one year, you can't leave a team without impact, you've
failed in your work. It's that simple.

One of the best ways to avoid this is apply to the leader-leader approach as
explained in the book [Turn the ship around]. Don't tell people what they have
to do but help them to define next steps and identify trade-offs. I always
try to make questions instead of give answers: "Have you tried ...?", "What
do you think of... ?", "What do you propose as alternative?", etc.

You will have a better life, and which it's more important, you will focus in
what's really important. The team will grow and learn and they will be happy
because of that. Being a hero, you are the villain. Don't do that.
