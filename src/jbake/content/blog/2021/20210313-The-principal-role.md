One of the things I couldn't answer in the last 4-5 years it was my role.

Am I a manager? No. I may manage people from an organization point of view but
my way to manage is exactly "don't manage" and let the team self organize.
I tent to focus more in the team and less in manage people.

Am I a developer? Well, code is something I like to do but I spent a lot more
time helping others to code than coding myself. Even more important, because of
interruptions, I don't enjoy too much coding new features. I prefer to work in
proof of concepts or refactoring. I also spend more time doing coding review
than coding myself.

An architect?. A big part of my work is to improve systems and platforms.
Listen problems and propose solutions. But I don't feel like the guy who do
a plan which must be followed by others. I see design and architecture as
something more collaborative and myself as a facilitator.

Even the term "Individual contributor" seems wrong. My contributions aren't
individual but for individuals.

As a brief summary:

- I prefer to help people instead of manage people.
- I like to be very involved in development but I don't want to code myself, at
  least the part which takes more time and need more focus.
- I help with ideas, patterns and processes to build better systems but I don't
  tell anybody who has to do.

I had no idea how to define it until I found this blog post: [Some Thoughts on
