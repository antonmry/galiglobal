## What's a Principal Software Engineer?

One of the things I couldn't answer in the last 4-5 years it was my role.

Am I a manager? No. I may manage people from an organization point of view but
my way to manage is "don't manage at all" and let the team self organize with
my help. I tent to focus more in the team and processes and less in people.

Am I a developer? Well, code is something I like to do but I spent a lot more
time helping others to code than coding myself. Even more important, because of
frequent interruptions, I don't enjoy too much coding new features. I prefer to
work in proof of concepts or refactoring because it isn't so problematic if I
have to stop and resume it later. I also spend more time doing coding review
than coding myself.

An architect? A big part of my work is to improve systems and platforms.
Listen problems and propose solutions. But I don't feel like the guy who do
a plan which must be blindly followed by others. I see design and architecture
as something more collaborative and myself as a facilitator. I usually share
my experience doing similar things in the past and I help to make people thing
out of the box, see their problems from a different perspective.

Am I a product manager? I work a lot with the roadmap and backlog of the
platforms where I'm more involved. Evangelize in the usage of the service is
very important. But this applies more for internal platforms. For public
services, it's just too much work and someone focused only on that is required.

Staff Engineer? That's a tricky one because it's very dependant of the
organization so I really don't have an answer for that. In some places, the role
is for seniors who jump between teams. In others, it's for engineers more
focused in processes than in systems. Anyway, in my opinion a Principal Software
Engineer builds long term relations with systems and teams, and it focus more
on the internal processes of the team (and the adoption) than in the
organization processes.

The list could continue: Systems Engineer, Support Engineer, DevOps, etc. Even
the term "Individual contributor" seems wrong. My contributions aren't
individual but for individuals. The reality of the role is to do whatever is
necessary to make teams and platforms succeed with freedom to choose the best
way to achieve it. A sort of technical "Jack of all trades, master of none".

One day I found this blog post in my timeline: [Some Thoughts on the Principal
Role]. Based in this article, it was clear to me:

- I prefer to help people instead of manage people.
- I like to be very involved in development but not necessarily code it myself,
  in special features which take more time and need more focus.
- I help with ideas, patterns and processes to build better systems but I don't
  tell anybody what has to do.

What a revelation! I've being a Principal Software Engineer for years without
be aware. Not only that, it's what I want to do, what makes me happy. It was
great to know there is a name for that and other people out there with the same
motivations and struggles. It's for that people, I wrote this article so I can
to share my main challenges and experiences in this role.

## No clear definition of the role: the management trap

Many organizations don't understand the role. They understand they need it but
not the role it-self. This tend to lead to the "we need people with strong
technical background to lead our teams" approach.

It's easier to fall in that trap. I think I'm joining the company as Principal
but I end working as Project Manager (or similar). I have experience as
Engineering Manager but even with that, things don't evolve well in this
situation. If I continue working as manager, I will slowly loose my technical
skills but the organization expects them so, in the long term, I won't meet
their expectations. If I focus more in the technical part, I will neglect
people I manage which it's the most important job of a manager. If, somehow,
I fight to keep both things I will end suffering job burnout. The article
[Maker's schedule, manager's schedule] is a great explanation about why both
things aren't compatible in the long term.

It isn't easy to solve this misalignment between the company and you. I usually
try to make alliances with other managers who want to be people managers so
I can focus in my role as engineer. I also evangelize about the role and how to
implement it properly in the organization. Some of my tasks (recruiting,
DevRel, community) require a lot of communication with HR and it helps to make
them see the need of separated technical and people roles.

If after a while things don't evolve, a job change is the only alternative.
Most of organizations tend to listen when their engineers leave so it's a good
opportunity to help them to make this right.

## Relation with managers

It's quite frustrating when managers take decisions without taking engineers in
account. It's specially problematic when they decide technical things which
have a huge impact in the platform.

Build a good relation with engineering managers is very important to succeed in
the role. They should ask about architecture and processes. Principals should
train them to have knowledge to report and publish to the rest of the
organization what we are doing.

This is particularly complex with managers who have a good technical
background. Because they tent to try to manage people and systems. They are too
busy so they take shortcuts: decide now, explain to the team later. It's hard
to deal with this because it's an organization issue. Managers should focus on
people, engineers on systems. Processes should be the common ground.

Another problem with managers is career evolution. If they see Principals as
competitors the relation can suffer. If they use their technical background as
a weapon to deal with politics, principals are a thread. I have seen very weird
executives meetings discussing deep technical things who nobody in the room
really understand. This is again, an organization problem. I deal with it
explaining from the very beginning I don't want their role. This seems to work
but it takes time to build that trustiness. Politics are hard and very harmful
for the organization.

## Don't be a hero

Another typical trap of the role is become a hero. It may happen for many
reasons, being the typical than it's easier to ask you about something than to
think about it. So other engineers may rely on you for tasks they don't like.

This isn't an issue when starting with a team but it's a huge problem in the
long term. If after one year, you can't leave a team without impact, you've
failed in your work. It's that simple.

One of the best ways to avoid this is apply the leader-leader approach as
explained in the book [Turn the ship around]. Don't tell people what they have
to do but help them to define next steps and identify trade-offs. I always
try to make questions instead of give answers: "Have you tried ...?", "What
do you think of... ?", "What do you propose as alternative?", etc. [Senior
Engineers build consensus].

You will have a better life, and which it's more important, you will focus in
what's really important. The team will grow and learn and they will be happy
because of that. Being a hero, you become the villain. Don't do that.

## Keep your optimism

Be a principal can be frustrating because your goals are now more aligned with
your organization. It's a technical role but it's also oriented to people. You
usually have a lot of meetings because of that, which it's probably one of the
reasons you didn't become a manager in first place. At some point you may sense
you aren't learning as much as you did in the past. That's a warning signal for
me: things have to change.

I take very seriously my happiness when working. So I don't try to push myself
too much to do things which I am not motivated to do. This works surprisingly
well because the principal role allows a lot of flexibility. Some days I may do
a PoC, others write a blog post to evangelize about some best practices at the
company level, attend meetings, review Pull Requests, etc.

Give you some space to experiment and do things which really motivates you is
essential to be successful in the long term. They may be not the most urgent
things for the company but, in my experience, that's exactly why they are
important. Principals should be able to see to the future and start that
journey. If you are stuck all the time in what's urgent, it's very difficult to
do that.

There is an excellent article about this: [Being glue]. It's from the
perspective of a junior software engineer which wants to be promoted but it
isn't because it's doing what's best for the team always. It ends bad. So,
instead, try to save some time to do whatever makes you happy in your work. In
the end, you will discover it has also value when properly combined with Glue
work.

## Career goals

One of the problems in the role is what's come next. The principal role is in
the end of the Individual Contributor path. Indeed, your contributions come now
from the group you are helping. Yes, you can aspire to add Senior or whatever
level number has your company... but that's just naming, which usually implies
better salary. Nobody complains for a salary raise but optimize to career based
in the salary is a quite bad idea if you are already covered.

You can aspire to a Distinguished / Fellow role but it doesn't seem right to me.
I always saw those roles as something really exceptional. The engineer who has
been in the company for ten years and initially designed the architecture
/ system. It may apply to some cases but I wouldn't say it's doable for most of
us, at least, not as goal which motivates you every day.

There is always the option to move to the Management track as Senior Engineer
Manager or Director. That's fine if it's what you want to do but it's just a
total different role and you should be aware of that. It has little value a
promotion if it makes your life miserable.

In summary, as Principal Software Engineer, promotions aren't going to be the
goal so you need to find new ones and that's highly dependant of each person.
In my case it's to learn new things. It has been always my passion and the
reason I'm a software engineer. This role allows me to learn new things every
day and help others. I can't ask for anything more.

## Don't stop coding

Coding is the last expression of a Software Engineer. It's how we transform
ideas in something real. It's also a very demanding task. If you stop coding
for a while, you loose a lot of fluency and it becomes very frustrating. If you
add the lack of your enough long slots in your calendar and all the
interruptions, it can be a nightmare. It's important for a Principal to feel
confident when coding even if it isn't her primary task anymore.

There are some tricks which help me with this:

* Try to block in your calendar some time everyday for coding: I usually use my
  early mornings. Most of the team isn't connected yet and I'm fresh. Start the
  day with a Pull Request is a great feeling.
* Avoid to work in things which are in the critical path: you aren't going to
  have time. You may think you will, but you don't. Deadline will arrive and
  the whole process will become very frustrating: deliver late or working
  after-hours. Both options are bad in the long term. So be realistic, don't
  work in critical features. I prefer to work in Technical Debt, refactorings
  or Proofs of Concept. There is a lot of value there because the team don't
  always have time to address these things and I can work without pressure.
