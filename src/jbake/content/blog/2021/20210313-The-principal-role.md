## What's a Principal Software Engineer?

One of the things I couldn't answer in the last 4-5 years it was my role.

Am I a manager? No. I may manage people from an organization point of view but
my way to manage is "don't manage at all" and let the team self organize with
my help. I tent to focus more in the team and processes and less in people
problems.

Am I a developer? Well, code is something I like to do but I spent a lot more
time helping others to code than coding myself. Even more important, because of
frequent interruptions, I don't enjoy too much coding new features. I prefer to
work in proof of concepts or refactoring because it isn't so problematic if I
have to stop and resume it later. I also spend more time doing coding review
than coding myself.

An architect? A big part of my work is to improve systems and platforms.
Listen problems and propose solutions. But I don't feel like the guy who do
a plan which must be blindly followed by others. I see design and architecture
as something more collaborative and myself as a facilitator. I usually share
my experience doing similar things in the past and I help to make people thing
out of the box, see their problems from a different perspective.

Am I a product manager? I work a lot with the roadmap and backlog of the
platforms where I'm more involved. Evangelize in the usage of the service is
very important. But this applies more for internal platforms. For public
services, it's just too much work and someone focused only on that is needed.

The list could continue: Systems Engineer, Support Engineer, DevOps, etc. Even
the term "Individual contributor" seems wrong. My contributions aren't
individual but for individuals. The reality of the role is to do whatever is
necessary to make teams and platforms succeed with freedom to choose the best
way to achieve it. A sort of technical "Jack of all trades, master of none".

One day I found this blog post in my timeline: [Some Thoughts on the Principal
Role]. Based in this article, it was clear to me:

- I prefer to help people instead of manage people.
- I like to be very involved in development but not necessarily code it myself,
  in special features which take more time and need more focus.
- I help with ideas, patterns and processes to build better systems but I don't
  tell anybody what has to do.

What a revelation! I'm a Principal Software Engineer. Not only that, it's what
I want to do, what makes me happy. It was great to know there is a name for that
and other people out there with the same motivations and struggles. For them,
I would like to share my main challenges with this role.

## No clear definition of the role: the management trap

Many organizations don't understand the role. It may not make sense in small
teams or immature organizations. They understand they need it but not the role
it-self. This tend to lead to the "we need people with strong technical
background to lead our teams" approach.

It's easier to fall in that trap. I think I'm joining the company as Principal
but I end working as Project Manager (or similar). I have experience as
Engineering Manager but even with that, things don't evolve well in this
situation. If I continue working as manager, I will slowly loose my technical
skills but the organization expects them so, in the long term, I won't meet
their expectations. If I focus more in the technical part, I will neglect
people I manage which it's the most important job of a manager. If, somehow,
I fight to keep both things it will end suffering job burnout.

It isn't easy to solve this. I usually try to make alliances with other
managers with want to be people managers so I can focus in my role as engineer.
I also start to evangelize about the role and how to implement it properly in
the organization. Some of my tasks (recruiting, DevRel, community) require
a lot of communication with HR and it does help to make them see the need of
separated technical and people roles.

If after a while things don't evolve, a job change is the only alternative.
Most of organizations tend to listen when their engineers leave.
