In May 2014, Oracle propose us to deploy and manage its [SANE solution](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/service-network-evolution/index.html) for the [TADHack event](http://tadhack.com/2014/) and support the developers community. With only a few weeks, it was a big challenge. I've participated as technical responsible and it was a great experience because it was a very different type of project: any operator was involved so we were free to choose the platform. Also the requirements were very different: the main goal was engage the developers.

This is the list of activities we did:
1. Create [a website](http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/) with all the information needed by the developers.
2. Create a [Github community](https://github.com/OTADHack) to provide source code samples, a ticketing system and so on.
3. We've deployed [Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html) and [Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html) in Amazon Web Services to give access to the developers.
* We run some webinars, as for example this one with [Alan Quayle](http://www.alanquayle.com/), Oracle Comms and [Alerant](http://www.alerant.com/):

It was a great experience and I hope to repeat the next year!.
