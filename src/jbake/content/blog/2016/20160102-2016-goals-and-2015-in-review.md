Another year is gone and as you can see in the look of the blog, I have a lot of new goals for this year :-). But first of all, a short review for 2015. My goals for the previous year were:

 * **Groovy as center of our universe**: achieved. Groovy is becoming a very important part in Oracle Comms Services Gatekeeper and Oracle Comms WebRTC Session Controller. We've embraced this change, and now we are working with [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) for deployments and with [Spock](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) for unit and integration testing. Also, as you can see, I have migrated the blog from Octopress to Hexo to [JBake](http://www.jbake.org), a blogging framework based in Java and Groovy. It's cool to publish your post using gradle :-)
 * **Embrace DevOps practices**: achieved. We are working now with Amazon AWS, docker, jenkins, github and artifactory. All of them integrated and providing an agile workflow which it's used and enjoyed by the whole team. There is room for improvement here but I'm happy with the steps we've already walked.
* **Became more fluent with Java**: partially achieved. I would like to pass the OCA and OCP exams and participate in some Java Open Source project. Any of them were possible because of lack of time. But I have started to use Intellij Idea and learn the shortcuts, read some books as [Netty in action](https://www.manning.com/books/netty-in-action), made [three Android courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mobilecloudcomputing2) in Coursera and more actions. I have to continue focusing on this, it's not easy because most of the development I'm able to do is out of the office in pet projects. Even if I have been working with Java since 2007, the only way to be really fluent in a language is practice, practice, practice... 
* **Learn more about [OCECAS](https://www.oracle.com/industries/communications/evolved-application-server/index.html)**: not achieved. I spent some time with the installation and reading the documentation but we didn't have time enough to build something, so it's not achieved... yet.
* **Improve the NetApps team**: achieved. I'm particularly proud of this, even if it's not only my achievement. The team has grown up and matured. Now we are a multidisciplinary team and I'm confident we are able to success in any Oracle SDP deployment, integration or customization. Everybody work in the same way using agile methodologies and DevOps practices.
* **Oracle Comms and ACE**: partially achieved. Become ACE Associate has been a great achievement. Also the participation in different events with Oracle Comms, launch this blog, write some articles, videos and other stuff. There is still a long way to go but I'm quite happy. 

In short, 2015 has been a quite good year, with interesting projects in Brazil, business trips to cool cities as London, Paris, Krakow, Barcelona or Lisbon. Also time to mature the team, learn new technologies and evolve our solutions. But now it's time to look to the future. Goals for 2016:

* **More focus**: I need to focus in things which matter. This is quite general but important. I'm always busy, but at the same time, I'm not sure how much time I spend doing valuable things. This post is part of my proposal for 2016: identify the key points for the next year and publish them. It should help me to make a real commitment.
* **DevOps, DevOps, DevOps**: in some way, I have been involved in DevOps all my professional life. Jumping from development to project management to system administration depending of the needs of the moment... the only things has been always there are Oracle Comms and how much I like to work with Linux, scripts, deployments and so on. I worked with Solaris Zones (precursor of Docker) and proposed to Vodafone in 2008... 8 years ago! And because of this, I'm always more focused in development and/or product/project management: those areas are not so natural for me and there is more room for improvement. Well, this has to change. There are a lot of new stuff now related to that and I want to learn more. This will mean start to use [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) and Google Cloud, continue with our Docker and Amazon AWS usage and, most important of all, integrate everything to work smoothly.  
* **The NetApps team**: we are in the good path and we'll continue in the same way. But there is a point we have to improve: the workflow is effective but quite complex for newcomers. That's the reason I've started a new book in [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com) titled [Development workflow for agile teams](https://leanpub.com/developmentworkflowforagileteams). This should help to solve the gap.
* **Don't use the mouse**: yes, I'm a vim fan and a linux user. My goal is just stop to use the mouse for all the task I do. I feel quite confident with Intellij Idea and the [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164?pr=idea), [Firefox vimperator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/) for browsing and the Linux console for most of the tasks. My main problems are with the email, calendar and some webs as Waffle and Feedly.... Something I'm working on. 
* **A pet project**: that's something I have been looking for some time without luck. I would like something related to Java/Groovy and WebRTC, working with others and not too complex to start with. Well, I hope 2016 is the year for this.
