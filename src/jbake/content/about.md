I am a passionate software engineer who specializes in the telecom business domain. I'm an [Oracle ACE Associate](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=19297:4:::NO:4:P4_ID:12240), Certified Implementation Specialist and a fan of Agile. I work as [Software Development Manager](http://bit.ly/antonmry-linkedin) with [Optare Solutions](http://www.optaresolutions.com). My professional interests include new technologies in web and telecom application development, design and integration patterns and DevOps practices.
