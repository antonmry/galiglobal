I am a passionate software development manager who specializes in the telecom business domain. I'm an [Oracle ACE Associate](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=19297:4:::NO:4:P4_ID:12240), Certified Implementation Specialist and a fan of Agile. I work as [Software Development Manager](http://bit.ly/antonmry-linkedin) with [Optare Solutions](http://www.optaresolutions.com). My professional interests include new technologies in web and telecom products, team workflow development and DevOps practices.

As [Oracle Communications Service and Network Evolution (SaNE) Solution](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/service-network-evolution/index.html) expert I've earned a wide experience with Oracle technologies (Weblogic, JavaEE), network protocols (SIP, WebRTC, Diameter, SMPP, REST/SOAP) and Implementation Specialist certifications in several Oracle products:

* [Oracle Communications Converged Application Server](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html)
* [Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html)
* [Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html)
* [Oracle Communication Evolved Application Server](https://www.oracle.com/industries/communications/evolved-application-server/index.html) 

I am also interesting in some cool Open Source projects and I like to participate as speaker at developer conferences, such as SpringIO, Geecon or TADSummit when I have the opportunity.
