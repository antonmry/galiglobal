I’m a Software Engineer focused on Data Pipelines (Spark) and Event Streaming (Kafka Streams, Flink). Nowadays I work for Inditex Group (Zara, Massimo Dutti, etc.) as Data Engineer. In the past, I worked as a specialist in Deployment Pipelines, API Management and Advanced Orchestration in distributed systems. I really enjoy building Data Pipelines with Java/Scala and deploying them to the Cloud or Kubernetes.

I am also interesting in some cool Open Source projects (check my [Github account](https://github.com/antonmry)). I like to participate as speaker at developer conferences, such as SpringIO, Geecon or TADSummit when I have the opportunity and I'm organising the [VigoJUG](http://www.vigojug.org) and [CoruñaJUG](http://www.corunajug.org). 

More information about me is available in [my Linkedin profile](http://bit.ly/antonmry-linkedin) or you can contact me at galiglobal@galiglobal.com.
