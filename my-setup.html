        <h1 id="my-setup">My setup</h1>
        <p>I've always spent a lot of time setting up my development environment. When I
        was 10 years old, I spent one year setting linux in my home computer. We didn't
        have internet, so I had to learn everything by myself. I remember that the X
        server setup was particularly hard. After that, I spent way too much recompiling
        the Linux kernet to make my laptop more performant. It was a lot of fun and,
        somehow, I still enjoy doing it.</p>
        <p>My current setup isn't particularly good, and I'm pretty sure it's not
        particularly reusable for others. But I wanted to document it anyway. Maybe it's
        inspiring for someone.</p>
        <h2 id="aesthetics">Aesthetics</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Always use a light theme for everything. I can't stand dark themes.</li>
        <li>I like to use a monospace font for everything. I use
          <a href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/ComicShannsMono">ComicShannsMono</a>.
          It's based in Comic Sans, weird, I know, but I find it very readable and
          that's what matter to me.</li>
        <li>Simplicity is key. I don't like cluttered interfaces. I don't use menus,
          toolbars, or anything that takes space on the screen.</li>
        <li>Shortcuts are mandatory. I try to use the keyboard as much as possible. I
          don't like to use the mouse.</li>
        <li>I disable notifications for almost everything, both in my phone and in my
          computer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see, my website follows the same principles.</p>
        <h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
        <p>Nothing special here. I have a M1 macbook because that's what my employer gave
        me. I would prefer to use a linux laptop. I had a pretty good experience in the
        past with a Slimbook and a Dell XPS Developer Edition. I only use a screen, a
        Dell UltraSharp 34. I'm still trying to get used to such a big screen. I like
        mechanical keyboards, but I don't use anything special: a Logitech Pop with the
        Spanish layout.</p>
        <p>TODO: webcam, mic and light.</p>
        <h2 id="operating-system">Operating System</h2>
        <p>My favourite operating system is Fedora with the i3 window manager. I've been
        using it for years. Unfortunately, I can't use it in my work laptop. I spent way
        too much time trying to use MacOs in a way that is similar and, in some aspects,
        I think I've succeeded. Animations are disabled, the bar is hidden, etc.</p>
        <p>I spend the 98% of my time in 5 different applications: the browser, the
        terminal, the IDE, Slack and Zoom. That's all. So those applications are always
        open in full screen mode and I switch between them using the keyboard. For
        example, Command+1 takes me to the browser, Command+2 to the terminal, etc. I'm
        so used to this that I can't use a computer without this setup.</p>
        <p>I use <a href="https://raycast.com/">Raycast</a> to launch applications. I don't even know
        how launch an application in the Mac without Raycast. I like to have some
        scripts to manage hardware, like the screen brightness, volume, lights, etc.</p>
        <p>TODO: brew, nix</p>
        <h2 id="browser">Browser</h2>
        <p>I'm using <a href="https://zen-browser.app/">Zen browser</a> these days. It's based on
        Firefox. It allows me to use a couple of extensions that are mandatory for me:
        <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">Vimium</a> and uBlock Origin. I don't have a strong
        preference for a browser.</p>
        <h2 id="terminal-and-shell">Terminal and shell</h2>
        <p>In the past I used Alacritty, but I'm using WezTerm now and I love it. There are
        three important things for me:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I don't want to see anything except the $.</li>
        <li>I want to configure everything with a single file.</li>
        <li>I need to be able to switch the command and the control keys only for the
          terminal (MacOS is configured to do it for all the other apps but that change
          breaks the shortcuts in the terminal).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, WezTerm will allow me to remove Tmux from my setup, that's still in
        my TODO list, though. I use Tmux a lot with a particular workflow: I usually
        have multiple windows and I rename them (Ctrl+b+,). Then, when I want to switch
        to a window, I use Ctrl+b+' and type the first letters of the name. This works
        very well for me because I never use tabs, so I can easily switch between
        windows and I don't care about the order of them.</p>
        <p>I use the same workflow everywhere: I don't use tabs, I don't reorder windows,
        etc. I just switch between windows, files, webpages, conversations, etc. using
        shortcuts and Fuzzy Search.</p>
