                        <div itemprop="blogPost">
                            <p><p>Last year I wrote a post with my goals for first time in my life. It was something new and I must say I&rsquo;ve read it many times to see how things are going. It has been a good experience and I want to repeat it this year.</p><p>2016 year has been, in the professional aspect, the best year of my life. Probably also in the personal aspect with a new kid. I&rsquo;m not going to speak too much about the last year, it was just great for me. I&rsquo;ve achieved some of the goals, failed in others, and there was new ones&hellip; That&rsquo;s the life.</p><p>Beginning of 2017 has been very stormy, even hard. Lots of problems, work and changes. That&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;ve waited so much to write this blog post. The good point when things are difficult is you are going to learn a lot. I have discovered things about my environment and myself which I&rsquo;ve never thought about before.</p><p>The first thing I&rsquo;ve discovered is the engineers &ldquo;ego problem&rdquo;. When you are fighting hard to make a project success, when you solve difficult problems, when you have to make your customers understand the consequences of their decisions or you are training younger engineers&hellip; Slowly but relentless the ego problem is growing on you. And let&rsquo;s make this clear: I&rsquo;m guilty. My motto always was: &ldquo;No project where I work can&rsquo;t fail&rdquo;. Now I understand how wrong I was. Project can be a huge success for the customer, but a big fail for your company or the team because the lost of trustiness or the casualties.. And now I know I had some failed projects in my life.</p><p>Other good sign of this are my proposals for the last year. All of them are about me. Again, the ego problem. The reason was my fear to be out of the IT jobs market. Be without a project or a salary really scares me. I think this is irrational, I have a B plan just in case I lost my job and I wasn&rsquo;t able to find a new one. Also I&rsquo;m receiving job offers every week, some of them really good ones (that does not help with the ego problem either). Probably it&rsquo;s more related to spend days without to do something useful and because I feel lucky to do what I do.</p><p>I deserve a punishment and 2017 will be the year to start with it.</p><p>First goal: repeat every morning in front of the mirror &ldquo;Be humble&rdquo; three times. If in some point of the day I fail on that, I will go to the involved person and I will ask for forgiveness. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a small fail or the involved person is a jerk, I will do it anyway.</p><p>Second goal: make the company where I work a better place to work. This means stop claiming and start to actively work in the solution to solve the problems I&rsquo;m claiming about. Let&rsquo;s make this clear: companies must earn money. But at the same time, employees must be feel involved, happy and positive. Both things are related. I&rsquo;m not sure how to do this or the real impact which I can have with my actions in a big company. I&rsquo;m just one, I&rsquo;m not a superhero and the company where I work is really good but there is always groom for improvement. It doesn&rsquo;t matter my role, I will just try to do as much as possible. Also I want to focus in the youngest engineers. In my opinion senior engineers should be more involved in professional evolution of the younger ones and I want to lead by example on that.</p><p>Third goal: return something to your local community. I can&rsquo;t believe this is a goal I have when I&rsquo;m 36 years old. Start so late on this is probably the biggest failure in my career. It was even more clear to me after an event last week for students. Two of the speakers made great points on the importance of contribute to your local community. I admire those two guys. I don&rsquo;t pretend to be like them but at least I want to do something. Start the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vigo-JUG/">VigoJUG</a> is a beginning. I hope to find other ways to contribute during the year. If you are reading this and you have any idea, please, let me know.</p><p>The last goal isn&rsquo;t really a goal but a fear. Yesterday a fellow said I&rsquo;m a Project Manager. It has been very painful for me because I realize he was partially right and I don&rsquo;t want that role anymore.</p><p><img src="http://assets.amuniversal.com/07b853c0c94f013441df005056a9545d" alt="Dilbert Has Management Potential""/></p><p>Last year I&rsquo;ve been developing a lot but 2017 has been crazy and I&rsquo;ve been more focused in solve problems and get things done&hellip; So my technical work has been reduced to Pull Request reviews and some time developing in the weekend. Rest of the time: mails, phone calls, write documents and meetings. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of my life doing only those things. I know they are useful and they are the way to achieve the goals I&rsquo;ve described before. But I&rsquo;ve spent 20 years of my life dealing with computers, I&rsquo;ve trained myself to learn vim shortcuts, researching how to write clean code, use the command shell, etc. and I don&rsquo;t want to loose that. It makes me feel happy and full. If I don&rsquo;t do it, I will end being sad and frustrated, so I have to found a way to conciliate both things. Any advise will be welcomed.</p><p>I want to finish this post asking for forgiveness. Specially during my time in Accenture I did a lot of wrong things. Not even close but I pushed too hard some times in Optare. If I did something which has troubled you, I&rsquo;m very sorry. I promise: I will be humble, I will be humble, I will be humble.</p></p>

                            <p><p>I&rsquo;m not a RestComm expert but I like to document the steps when I do something. It&rsquo;s quite schematic but yet, it may help someone. Start to contribute to RestComm is really hard because the lack of documentation and all the team very busy. But it&rsquo;s a interesting project and a nice community.</p><p>The idea is quite simple: show how how create two PRs: one for Restcomm-Docker, another for Restcomm-Connect.</p><h2>What do you need?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Java 7 development environment</li>
  <li>Ant and maven</li>
  <li>docker</li>
</ol><p>So, what is the first step to become a RestComm maniac?</p><h2>Download the source code</h2><p>The easy part, I love github:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">git clone git@github.com:antonmry/Restcomm-Connect.git
git clone git@github.com:antonmry/Restcomm-Docker.git
cd Restcomm-Docker/
git remote add upstream git@github.com:RestComm/Restcomm-Docker.git
cd ../Restcomm-Connect/
git remote add upstream git@github.com:RestComm/Restcomm-Connect.git
</code></pre><p>If you&rsquo;ve done it previously, it&rsquo;s a good moment to sync with the official respository:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git push
</code></pre><h2>RestComm-Docker</h2><p>Now we are going to set up the RestComm environment: docker to the rescue!</p><p>I always create a local branch to do my work:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cd ../Restcomm-Docker/
git checkout -b s3bucketRegion#1
git push -u origin s3bucketRegion#1
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="sh">docker build -t restcomm/yourname:latest -f Dockerfile .

                            <p><p>Another year is gone and as you can see in the look of the blog, I have a lot of new goals for this year :-). In short, 2015 has been a quite good year, with interesting projects in Brazil, business trips to cool cities as London, Paris, Krakow, Barcelona or Lisbon. Also time to mature the team, learn new technologies and evolve our solutions. But now it&rsquo;s time to look to the future. Goals for 2016:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DevOps, DevOps, DevOps</strong>: in some way, I have been involved in DevOps all my professional life. Jumping from development to project management to system administration depending of the needs of the moment&hellip; the only things has been always there are Oracle Comms and how much I like to work with Linux, scripts, deployments and so on. I worked with Solaris Zones (precursor of Docker) and proposed to Vodafone in 2008&hellip; 8 years ago! And because of this, I&rsquo;m always more focused in development and/or product/project management: those areas are not so natural for me and there is more room for improvement. Well, this has to change. There are a lot of new stuff now related to that and I want to learn more. This will mean start to use <a href="https://github.com/aestasit/sshoogr">sshoogr</a> (Ansible-like but using Groovy), improve our Docker and Amazon AWS usage and, most important of all, integrate everything to work smoothly.</li>
  <li><strong>Groovy as center of our universe</strong>: Groovy is becoming a very important part in Oracle Comms Services Gatekeeper and Oracle Comms WebRTC Session Controller. We&rsquo;ve embraced this change, and now we are working with <a href="http://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a> for deployments and with <a href="https://github.com/spockframework/spock">Spock</a> for unit and integration testing. Also, as you can see, I have migrated the blog from Octopress to Hexo to <a href="http://www.jbake.org">JBake</a>, a blogging framework based in Java and Groovy. It&rsquo;s cool to publish your post using gradle :-)</li>
  <li><strong>Became even more fluent with Java</strong>: I have started to use Intellij Idea and learn the shortcuts, read some books as <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/netty-in-action">Netty in action</a>, made <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mobilecloudcomputing2">three Android courses</a> in Coursera and more activities. I have to continue focusing on this, it&rsquo;s not easy because most of the development I&rsquo;m able to do is out of the office in pet projects, training or peer reviews. I have been working with Java since 2007 but the only way to continue being fluent in a language is practice, practice, practice&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong>Oracle Comms and ACE</strong>: Become ACE Associate has been a great achievement. Also the participation in different events with Oracle Comms, launch this blog, write some articles, videos and other stuff. I&rsquo;m quite happy but there is still a long way&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong>Improving the team</strong>: our workflow is effective but there is a point we have to improve: it&rsquo;s quite complex for newcomers. That&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;ve started a new book in <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> titled <a href="https://leanpub.com/developmentworkflowforagileteams">Development workflow for agile teams</a> focused in our workflow. This should help to solve the gap.</li>
  <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t use the mouse</strong>: yes, I&rsquo;m a vim fan and a linux user. My goal is just stop to use the mouse for all the task I do. I feel quite confident with Intellij Idea now and the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164?pr=idea">IdeaVim</a> plugin, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/">Firefox vimperator</a> for browsing and the Linux console for most of the tasks. My main problems are with the email, calendar and some webs as Waffle and Feedly&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong>A pet project</strong>: that&rsquo;s something I have been looking for some time without luck. I would like to build something using Java/Groovy and WebRTC, working with others in something not too complex to start with / greenfield. Well, I hope 2016 is the year for this.</li>
</ul><p>That&rsquo;s all! <strong>Happy and prosperous 2016!!</strong>.</p></p>

                        <div itemprop="blogPost">
                            <p><p>Without any type of doubt, <a href="http://www.tadhack.com">TADHack</a> is my favourite event in the year. Mainly because of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Excellent collaborative atmosphere and lots of friends. I love to have the opportunity to share some time with people involved in the same topics I&rsquo;m working with. And not only that, it&rsquo;s full of techies :-)</li>
  <li>Event is well managed by Alan Quayle and his team. Everything goes smoothly and you are always busy speaking, developing, visiting other vendors or watching other hacks.</li>
  <li>It&rsquo;s not too big, so you have the chance to have a chat with almost everybody&hellip; this seems weird but when I&rsquo;m participating in bigger events, I&rsquo;ve the feeling I don&rsquo;t have time enough to speak with all people I would like to speak with. That doesn&rsquo;t happen in TADHack.</li>
</ul><p>My participation in this event is mainly because we are running and providing support for the Oracle Comms environment, there is a web with information about all the resources in case you are interested: <a href="http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com">http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com</a>. Even if it&rsquo;s the second year we are doing it, the installation of the three Oracle SDP products it&rsquo;s not straightforward. We had to update to the last versions of the products and we are always looking for ways to improve it. It&rsquo;s not a secret we are using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/">Amazon Web Services</a> to support this infrastructure. Some day I have to write a post about the whole infrastructure and how we are using AWS to support the service. The part about how we upload the VMs to AWS EC2 is quite awesome and tricky because some of them are based in customized Linux versions.</p><p>One of the most interesting things this year was the opportunity to participate as developers. Obviously we cannot be winners of the Oracle prize, it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair, but we can combine the Oracle environment with other sponsors, in this case we chose Intel providing an embedded board. Also we have a new member in the NetApps team, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathrodriguez">Jonathan</a>, who is a great Java and Android developer. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgYdT9Q7OWw">Here</a> it&rsquo;s the video where he&rsquo;s showing the hack in Lisbon:</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgYdT9Q7OWw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>And now the big news&hellip; we won!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Heart Rate Monitor team, winners of <a href="https://twitter.com/Inteliot">@Inteliot</a> prize at <a href="https://twitter.com/TADHack">@TADHack</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/antonmry">@antonmry</a> <a href="http://t.co/iPbWtemQ25">pic.twitter.com/iPbWtemQ25</a></p>&mdash; Alan Quayle (@Alan_Quayle) <a href="https://twitter.com/Alan_Quayle/status/610618140918157313">June 16, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>You can see my big smile in the photo. I&rsquo;m more than happy being one of the winners. I guess I always have been a bit jealous of the others developers :-)</p><p>In short, TADHack 2015 has been great and bigger than the 2014 edition. The TAD ecosystem is evolving very quick and I&rsquo;m really excited to see how this evolves in the following years.</p></p>

                            <p><p>I&rsquo;ve been invited by Oracle Comms to join <a href="http://2015.geecon.org/speakers/info.html?id=70">Geecon 2015</a> to speak about Web Real Time Commutations – Voice, Video, and Data Communications with my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait">Douglas Tait</a>. It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to work with someone as Doug and his feedback about previous editions was really good, so I was more than happy to participate in this event.</p><p>When I joined the event, I quickly realized Doug was right. There are all things you can expect from a developer event but mixed with a lot of fun things. Everybody is really friendly, organizers made a huge effort to make everybody feel really well. There are a lot of jokes. I really like the speakers hats, even if my head is too big for them, I know, it&rsquo;s my fault ;-)</p><p>One of the things I was more impressed with it&rsquo;s the place itself. It&rsquo;s a commercial cinema in Krakow. So everyday when the event ends, movies start. It&rsquo;s awesome. The place is perfect for conferences: great sound, great screen, comfortable chairs, etc. At the same time, it should be easy to book it, most of the cinemas are empty now, at least in Spain. It&rsquo;s a great idea and a good example of how Geecon organizers are able to think out of the box.</p><p>The other thing I really enjoyed it was the attendees. They were very participative, making good questions, proposing new ideas. In one of the conferences, even helped the speaker with some IntelliJ Idea shortcuts, really cool! With our talk it wasn&rsquo;t different, they made a lot of questions and we finished speaking with a lot of them. For something so specific as WebRTC and communications, it was great to see some people really interested on it. I have been always jealous of the Java ecosystem in relation to the TAD ecosystem, even with the great help of TADHack, there is a big gap yet.</p><p>Our talk was about how Java helps in communications, with focus on WebRTC, SIP and Telecom APIs. People was more interested in WebRTC than any other subject. We run some demos, show some code and made some jokes. <a href="https://vimeo.com/131761796">Here</a> it&rsquo;s the video recorded by the Geecon organizers:</p><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/131761796" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/131761796">GeeCON 2015: Ant&oacute;n Yuste, Douglas Tait - Web Real Time Commutations &ndash; Voice, Video, and Data Communications</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/geecon">GeeCON Conference</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p><p>I really would like to repeat next year. This is one of the best events where I had the opportunity to participate.</p></p>
