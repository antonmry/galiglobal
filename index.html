                        <div itemprop="blogPost">
                            <p><p>Last year I wrote a post with my goals for first time in my life. It was something new and I must say I&rsquo;ve read it many times to see how things are going. It has been a good experience and I want to repeat it this year.</p><p>2016 year has been, in the professional aspect, the best year of my life. Probably also in the personal aspect with a new kid. I&rsquo;m not going to speak too much about the last year, it was just great for me. I&rsquo;ve achieved some of the goals, failed in others, and there was new ones&hellip; That&rsquo;s the life.</p><p>Beginning of 2017 has been very stormy, even hard. Lots of problems, work and changes. That&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;ve waited so much to write this blog post. The good point when things are difficult is you are going to learn a lot. I have discovered things about my environment and myself which I&rsquo;ve never thought about before.</p><p>The first thing I&rsquo;ve discovered is the engineers &ldquo;ego problem&rdquo;. When you are fighting hard to make a project success, when you solve difficult problems, when you have to make your customers understand the consequences of their decisions or you are training younger engineers&hellip; Slowly but relentless the ego problem is growing on you. And let&rsquo;s make this clear: I&rsquo;m guilty. My motto always was: &ldquo;No project where I work can&rsquo;t fail&rdquo;. Now I understand how wrong I was. Project can be a huge success for the customer, but a big fail for your company or the team because the lost of trustiness or the casualties.. And now I know I had some failed projects in my life.</p><p>Other good sign of this is my proposals for the last year. All of them are about me. Again, the ego problem. The reason was my fear to be out of the IT jobs market. Be without a project or a salary really scares me. I think this is irrational, I have a B plan just in case I loose my job and I wasn&rsquo;t able to find a new one. Also I&rsquo;m receiving job offers every week, some of them really good ones (that does not help with the ego problem either). Probably it&rsquo;s more related to spend days without to do something useful and because I feel lucky to do what I do.</p><p>I deserve a punishment and 2017 will be the year to start with it.</p><p>First goal: repeat every morning in front of the mirror &ldquo;Be humble&rdquo; three times. If in some point of the day I fail on that, I will go to the involved person and I will ask for forgiveness. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a small fail or the involved person is a jerk, I will do it anyway.</p><p>Second goal: make the company where I work a better place to work. This means stop claiming and start to actively work in the solution to solve the problems I&rsquo;m claiming about. Let&rsquo;s make this clear: companies must earn money. But at the same time, employees must be feel involved, happy and positive. Both things are related. I&rsquo;m not sure how to do this or the real impact which I can have with my actions in a big company. I&rsquo;m just one, I&rsquo;m not a superhero and the company where I work is really good but there is always groom for improvement. It doesn&rsquo;t matter my role, I will just try to do as much as possible. Also I want to focus in the youngest engineers. In my opinion senior engineers should be more involved in professional evolution of the younger ones and I want to lead by example on that.</p><p>Third goal: return something to your local community. I can&rsquo;t believe this is a goal I have when I&rsquo;m 36 years old. Start so late on this is probably the biggest failure in my career. It was even more clear to me after an event last week for students. Two of the speakers made great points on the importance of contribute to your local community. I admire those two guys. I don&rsquo;t pretend to be like them but at least I want to do something. Start the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vigo-JUG/">VigoJUG</a> is a beginning. I hope to find other ways to contribute during the year. If you are reading this and you have any idea, please, let me know.</p><p>The last goal isn&rsquo;t really a goal but a fear. Yesterday a fellow said I&rsquo;m a Project Manager. It has been very painful for me because I realize he was partially right and I don&rsquo;t want that role anymore.</p><p><img src="http://assets.amuniversal.com/07b853c0c94f013441df005056a9545d" alt="Dilbert Has Management Potential""/></p><p>Last year I&rsquo;ve been developing a lot but 2017 has been crazy and I&rsquo;ve been more focused in solve problems and get things done&hellip; So my technical work has been reduced to Pull Request reviews and some time developing in the weekend. Rest of the time: mails, phone calls, write documents and meetings. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of my life doing only those things. I know they are useful and they are the way to achieve the goals I&rsquo;ve described before. But I&rsquo;ve spent 20 years of my life dealing with computers, I&rsquo;ve trained myself to learn vim shortcuts, researching how to write clean code, use the command shell, etc. and I don&rsquo;t want to loose that. It makes me feel happy and full. If I don&rsquo;t do it, I will end being sad and frustrated, so I have to found a way to conciliate both things. Any advise will be welcomed.</p><p>I want to finish this post asking for forgiveness. Specially during my time in Accenture I did a lot of wrong things. Not even close but I pushed too hard some times in Optare. If I did something which has troubled you, I&rsquo;m very sorry. I promise: I will be humble, I will be humble, I will be humble.</p></p>

                        <div itemprop="blogPost">
                            <p><p>In my previous post, <a href="https://antonmry.github.io/post/deploy-on-kubernetes-gke-with-terraform/">Deploy on Kubernetes GKE with Terraform</a>, we&rsquo;ve seen how to start to use kubernetes but in a very simple way. The next thing we would like to do is persist the configuration, so we don&rsquo;t need to reconfigure our bot each time we start the cluster. This post explain how to do it from the configuration created in the previous one.</p><p>Again we&rsquo;ll use <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/leanmanager">Leanmanager bot</a> but everything applies to any other system which needs to store configuration or data in a database. In the case of <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/leanmanager">Leanmanager</a> we are using <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">Boltdb</a>, a pure Go key/value store. <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">Boltdb</a> is great for development but it doesn&rsquo;t support to have more than one process opening the same database file, so it may be problematic if we want to have more than one Docker instance at the same time. Yet it&rsquo;s enough for our purposes and the process is similar for <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> which it&rsquo;s already in the Roadmap.</p><h2>Create your persistent disks</h2><p>If we want to persist data, we are going to need a disk, that&rsquo;s common sense. In GCE we can do it very easily:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">gcloud compute disks create --size 1GB leanmanager-disk
</code></pre><p>But again, we want to do it in an automated way with Terraform. Use the following file <code>leanmanager-disk.tf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>variable &quot;disk_name&quot; {
  default = &quot;leanmanager-disk&quot;
}

resource &quot;google_compute_disk&quot; &quot;default&quot; {
name  = &quot;${var.disk_name}&quot;
  type  = &quot;pd-ssd&quot;
  zone = &quot;${var.region}&quot;
  size  = &quot;1&quot;
}
</code></pre><p>If you want to know more about it, visit the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_disk.html">Terraform Google_Compute_Disk reference documentation</a>.</p><h2>Tell the container about the disk</h2><p>In our previous post, we&rsquo;ve launched the bot using <code>kubectl run</code>. This is OK for simple configuration but if we need to have something more complex, it doesn&rsquo;t scale. We can create a <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/">pod</a>, a group of one or more containers, using a YAML file like this:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: leanmanager
  labels:
    name: leanmanager
spec:
  containers:
    - image: antonmry/leanmanager:latest
      name: leanmanager
      env:
        - name: LEANMANAGER_TOKEN
          value: LEANMANAGER_TOKEN_TEMPLATE
        - name: LEANMANAGER_PATHDB
          value: /mnt
      volumeMounts:
          # This name must match the volumes.name below.
        - name: leanmanager-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /mnt
  volumes:
    - name: leanmanager-persistent-storage
      gcePersistentDisk:
        # This disk must already exist.
        pdName: leanmanager-disk
        fsType: ext4
</code></pre><p>The file is auto-explanatory except the value <code>LEANMANAGER_TOKEN_TEMPLATE</code>. I don&rsquo;t want to hardcode the Token here because the file will be uploaded to Github. Instead of that, I want to use my local environment variable LEANMANAGER_TOKEN but this isn&rsquo;t supported yet in K8s, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33478555/kubernetes-equivalent-of-env-file-in-docker">Kubernetes equivalent of env-file in Docker</a>. </p><p>So I&rsquo;ve created a YAML template and in the Terraform file changed the last <code>local-exec</code> to:</p>
<pre><code>  provisioner &quot;local-exec&quot; {
    command = &quot;cp leanmanager-pod-template.yaml leanmanager.tmp.yaml &amp;&amp; sed -i -- &#39;s/LEANMANAGER_TOKEN_TEMPLATE/${var.LEANMANAGER_TOKEN}/g&#39; leanmanager.tmp.yaml&quot;
  }

  provisioner &quot;local-exec&quot; {
    command = &quot;kubectl create -f leanmanager.tmp.yaml&quot;
  }

  provisioner &quot;local-exec&quot; {
    command = &quot;rm -f leanmanager.tmp.yaml&quot;
  }
</code></pre><p>Basically, I&rsquo;m replacing strings with <code>sed</code>. Other more sophisticate approaches are possible as K8s secrets or Ansible, but this is simple and enough for the task we want to do.</p><h2>Create the pod and test</h2><p>Time to create the cluster and the pod:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">terraform plan
terraform apply -var LEANMANAGER_TOKEN=$LEANMANAGER_TOKEN
</code></pre><p>The bot should connect. Now we can do some changes in the configuration, delete the pod:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">kubectl delete pod leanmanager
</code></pre><p>Create it again:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">kubectl create -f leanmanager.yaml
</code></pre><p>And check the status with the following commands and, once it&rsquo;s in <em>Running</em> state, see if everything has been persisted:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">kubectl get pod leanmanager
kubectl logs leanmanager
</code></pre><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Persist data in Kubernetes is quite easy, even if you are going to do it automatically.</p><p>If you want to check all the files, the full project and the associated PR are in <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/leanmanager/pull/27/commits/ffea981b5deca5376b7bb8de1ed797da9aa282b0">Github</a>.</p><h2>Not already linked but useful resources</h2>

                        <div itemprop="blogPost">
                            <p><h2>Microservices don&rsquo;t fit all use cases</h2><p>When I&rsquo;ve started <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/leanmanager">my Leanmanager bot</a>, I&rsquo;ve chosen to use the same approach (well, really it&rsquo;s a framework but that word seems to be censured if you are a gopher so I will use <em>approach</em>) as the kubernetes project: if it&rsquo;s good for k8s, it should be good for me and also a good way to learn a bit more about kubernetes. So I&rsquo;ve implemented all the REST APIs using <a href="https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful">github.com/emicklei/go-restful</a>.</p><p>Then I had the opportunity to work a bit with <a href="https://gokit.io/">go-kit</a>. A framework, ups, no, sorry, a toolkit to create microservices. My initial opinion was too complicated and too much boilerplate. Yet I would like to give it another opportunity, there are some interesting things useful for bots (support many transports, RPC approach, instrumentation) and my main motivation with the bot is to test new technologies and ideas so&hellip; why not?</p><p>If you visit the <a href="https://gokit.io">Go-kit website</a>, and then, you will jump very soon into the <a href="https://gokit.io/examples/stringsvc.html">stringsvc tutorial</a>. The tutorial is awesome but it isn&rsquo;t a five minutes read and it&rsquo;s a bit too complicated to start to work with Go-kit. I recommend an approach a bit different. First, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXEjAwNWays">Go + Microservices = Go Kit</a> from <a href="https://peter.bourgon.org/">Peter Bourgon</a>. This is an awesome talk explaining microservices and their use cases. Clearly Peter knows a lot about the subject: microservices aren&rsquo;t for everyone.</p><p>If after the video, you think microservices fit your case, go ahead and may the Force be with you.</p><h2>Go-kit addsvc example</h2><p>First step, download Go-kit:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">go get github.com/go-kit/kit
</code></pre><p>Then, just copy the <a href="https://github.com/go-kit/kit/tree/master/examples/addsvc">addsvc example</a> and download the dependencies (this may take a while depending of what you&rsquo;ve already in the GOPATH).</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cp -r ../../go-kit/kit/examples/addsvc/ .
go get ./...
</code></pre><p>The plan is simple, modify it to fit your use case while you are becoming more familiar with go-kit. But first, let&rsquo;s try the example. Launch the server:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cd cmd/addsvc/
go run main.go
</code></pre><p>And in a different shell, launch the client:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cd cmd/addcli/
go run main.go -http.addr=:8081 1 2
</code></pre><p>If everything goes well, you will obtain something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 + 2 = 3</p>
</blockquote><p>Or you can use <code>curl</code> directly:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">curl -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -X POST -d &#39;{&quot;A&quot;:&quot;xyz&quot;,&quot;B&quot;:&quot;abc&quot;}&#39; http://localhost:8081/concat
</code></pre><p>There are some things to note now. First, the example has two methods, one for add numbers and another one to concat strings. Also, it supports many transport protocols, not only http, so you can launch the client using gRPC:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">go run main.go -grpc.addr=:8082 1 2
</code></pre><h2>Show me the code!</h2><p>It&rsquo;s time to go deeper. Open <code>service.go</code>. This is the file where the service definition is described and also implemented for this example.</p><p>Note: I may continue this in the future if I resume my work with go-kit.</p></p>

                        <div itemprop="blogPost">
                            <p><p>Writing a new post after six months and in Christmas&hellip; New year, new promises, old projects. I&rsquo;ve been quite busy the second half of 2016, but also very happy and satisfied with some personal and professional projects. No more excuses and let&rsquo;s focus in this post.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I want to deploy my <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/antonmry/leanmanager">leanmanager Docker image</a> so the bot is available all the time for the team, but you can choose any Docker image you want to use. I want to use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/quickstart">Google Container Engine</a> Kubernetes implementation and do it everything as much automatic as possible using Terraform.</p><h2>GCE installation</h2><p>First step, make sure you&rsquo;ve created previously a project in the Google Cloud console. If you don&rsquo;t have the Cloud SDK, you are going to need it. It&rsquo;s quite easy to install following <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-linux">the Google instructions</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cd ~/Software
curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-sdk-138.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf google-cloud-sdk-138.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
rm google-cloud-sdk-138.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
</code></pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: be careful, last command modifies your .bashrc and it may cause problems.</p><p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to log in:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">gcloud init
</code></pre><p>And now, install kubectl, the client to manage kubernetes:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">gcloud components install kubectl
</code></pre><h2>Launching the service</h2><p>The first step is to create the cluster. It may take some time.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">gcloud container clusters create leanmanager-cluster
</code></pre><p>Ensure kubectl can access to the service:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">gcloud auth application-default login
</code></pre><p>And now, it&rsquo;s time to launch the leanmanager image:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">kubectl run leanmanager-node --image=antonmry/leanmanager:latest --env=&quot;LEANMANAGER_TOKEN=$LEANMANAGER_TOKEN&quot;
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> I have an environment variable <code>LEANMANAGER_TOKEN</code> with the token to authenticate to Slack. The bot automatically connects using Websocket but if you want to expose any service, add <code>--port=8080</code> to allow access to it. You will need also to create a Load Balancer, the steps are explained <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/quickstart">here</a>.</p><h2>Clean the service</h2><p>To stop the service and delete the cluster:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">gcloud container clusters delete leanmanager-cluster
</code></pre><h2>Install Terraform</h2><p>Our next step it&rsquo;s going to be to automate all the process. To do it, we&rsquo;ll use <a href="https://www.terraform.io">Terraform</a>.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t have it, first step is download it from <a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html">here</a> and install it. For linux:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.8.2/terraform_0.8.2_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.8.2_linux_amd64.zip
</code></pre><p>Now move it to a folder which is in your PATH, in my case:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">terraform ~/bin/
echo terraform &gt;&gt; ~/bin/.gitignore
</code></pre><p>Last command is executed because I&rsquo;ve <code>~/bin</code> in github but I don&rsquo;t want upload a so big file as <code>terraform</code> executable.</p><p>Now you should be able to use <code>terraform</code> in your system. If you&rsquo;ve never used before, it&rsquo;s a good moment to read the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/build.html">Getting started guide</a>.</p><h2>Download GKE credentials</h2><p>Follow these instructions to download the credentials file:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log into the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com">Google Developers Console</a> and select a project.</li>
  <li>Click the menu button in the top left corner, and navigate to &ldquo;IAM &amp; Admin&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Service accounts&rdquo;, and finally &ldquo;Create service account&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>Provide a name and ID in the corresponding fields, select &ldquo;Furnish a new private key&rdquo;, and select &ldquo;JSON&rdquo; as the key type.</li>
  <li>Clicking &ldquo;Create&rdquo; will download your credentials.</li>
  <li>Rename it to <code>account.json</code>. Make sure you don&rsquo;t publish this file, for instance in Github (add it to <code>.gitignore</code>).</li>
</ol><h2>Create the cluster using Terraform</h2><p>In the same folder you have your <code>account.json</code>, create a Terraform file like <code>leanmanager.tf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>variable &quot;region&quot; {
  default = &quot;europe-west1-d&quot;
}

provider &quot;google&quot; {
  credentials = &quot;${file(&quot;account.json&quot;)}&quot;
  project     = &quot;wwwleanmanagereu&quot;
  region      = &quot;${var.region}&quot;
}

resource &quot;google_container_cluster&quot; &quot;primary&quot; {
  name = &quot;leanmanager-cluster&quot;
  zone = &quot;${var.region}&quot;
  initial_node_count = 1

  master_auth {
    username = &quot;mr.yoda&quot;
    password = &quot;testTest1&quot;
  }

  node_config {
    oauth_scopes = [
      &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute&quot;,
      &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only&quot;,
      &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write&quot;,
      &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring&quot;
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Check what it&rsquo;s going to create:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">terraform plan
</code></pre><p>Review the output and if it&rsquo;s ok, launch it!.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">terraform apply
</code></pre><p>If everything goes well, you will see a message like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.</p>
</blockquote><p>And you can check it with:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">gcloud container clusters list
</code></pre><p>If you want to access with <code>kubectl</code> you need to login first:</p>
<pre><code>gcloud container clusters get-credentials leanmanager-cluster --zone europe-west1-d
kubectl cluster-info
</code></pre><p>This step can be added to the <code>leanmanager.tf</code> inside the <code>resource</code> block:</p>
<pre><code>provisioner &quot;local-exec&quot; {
    command = &quot;gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${var.cluster_name} --zone ${google_container_cluster.primary.zone}&quot;
}
</code></pre><h2>Launch our Docker instance</h2><p>Once you are logged in with <code>kubectl</code>, it&rsquo;s exactly the same as before:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">kubectl run leanmanager-node --image=antonmry/leanmanager:latest --env=&quot;LEANMANAGER_TOKEN=$LEANMANAGER_TOKEN&quot;
</code></pre><p>But you can also do it with Terraform adding this snippet in the beginning: </p>
<pre><code>variable &quot;LEANMANAGER_TOKEN&quot; {
      default = &quot;USE YOUR OWN TOKEN&quot;
}
</code></pre><p>And after the previous <code>local-exec</code>:</p>
<pre><code>provisioner &quot;local-exec&quot; {
    command = &quot;kubectl run leanmanager-node --image=antonmry/leanmanager:latest --env=LEANMANAGER_TOKEN=${var.LEANMANAGER_TOKEN}&quot;
}
</code></pre><p>And executing terraform passing the variable:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">terraform apply -var LEANMANAGER_TOKEN=$LEANMANAGER_TOKEN
</code></pre><p>Other option would be read the variable directly but you have to change the name to fit the terraform requirements and I&rsquo;m using it for other things. More info <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Clean everything</h2><p>With Terraform is really easy, just:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">terraform destroy
</code></pre><h2>Not already linked but useful resources</h2>

                            <p><p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to show how to create a Kubernetes Development Environment and deploy RestComm (a quite complex software) on it for testing. If you want just deploy RestComm, it&rsquo;s better for you use the <a href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/docker/">Kubernetes Docker option</a>, instead of doing all this process.</p><h1>Install Go Development Environment</h1>
<pre><code class="sh">curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz

</code></pre><h1>Basic Kubernetes installation</h1><h2>Clone and download</h2>
<pre><code class="sh">mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/k8s.io
cd $GOPATH/src/k8s.io
git clone https://github.com/antonmry/kubernetes.git
cd kubernetes
git remote add upstream &#39;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.git&#39;
</code></pre><h2>Build and unit test</h2>
<pre><code class="sh">./hack/build-go.sh &amp;&amp; notify-send &quot;Compilation done&quot;
</code></pre><p>Note! Integration test take a long time.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">./hack/test-go.sh &amp;&amp; notify-send &quot;Test done&quot;
</code></pre><h2>Integration test</h2><p>We need etcd to run the integration test, Docker to the rescue?</p>
<pre><code class="sh">docker run -d --name etcd quay.io/coreos/etcd:v2.3.3
alias etcdctl=&quot;docker exec etcd /etcdctl&quot;
alias etcd=&quot;docker exec etcd /etcd&quot;
</code></pre><p>Nop, it fails because kubernetes look for it in the PATH :-(</p><p>So,</p>
<pre><code class="sh">curl -O  https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.3.3/etcd-v2.3.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz

</code></pre><p>And now, time to test. Be careful, I think it uses your Google Cloud account :-S</p>
<pre><code class="sh">go run hack/e2e.go -v --build --up --test --down &amp;&amp; notify-send &quot;Integration test done&quot;
</code></pre><h1>Running the Restcomm image</h1><h2>Creating and launching the cluster</h2><p>It will ask for sudo permission, you have to be quick, or relaunch.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">hack/local-up-cluster.sh
</code></pre><p>Let this terminal open and create a new one (tmux&rsquo;s time?)</p><h2>Running the container</h2><p>We don&rsquo;t have any container running:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cluster/kubectl.sh get pods
cluster/kubectl.sh get services
cluster/kubectl.sh get deployments
</code></pre><p>Time to launch RestComm:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/antonmry/0ab69e95e61617eb957a79beb25ba30b/raw/c5c2979be63297571968f7db88c27e714e557fca/restcomm_rc.yml
vim restcomm_rc.yml 
</code></pre><p>Change STATIC_ADDRESS to your own IP address.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cluster/kubectl.sh create -f restcomm_rc.yml
</code></pre><p>Now we should be able to see our docker instance working, pods and so on.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cluster/kubectl.sh get services
cluster/kubectl.sh get deployments
cluster/kubectl.sh get pods
</code></pre><p>We have to wait the STATUS pod become running instead of ContainerCreating.</p><p>After that, we can see our RestComm containers running:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">docker images
docker ps
</code></pre><p>Once it&rsquo;s running, we can expose the ports to access our instance:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">wget -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/antonmry/0ab69e95e61617eb957a79beb25ba30b/raw/77c4eea558fcba9a1ad09d9b89221fdbe3a263fe/restcomm_service.yml
vim restcomm_service.yml
</code></pre><p>Change externalIPs to your own IP address.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">cluster/kubectl.sh create -f restcomm_service.yml
</code></pre><p>With the following command we can check the status:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">./cluster/kubectl.sh get svc
</code></pre><h1>Test Restcomm!</h1>
<pre><code class="sh">chromium-browser https://CHANGE_WITH_YOUR_IP/olympus
</code></pre><p>Login as alice, call +1234 and you should listen the message ;-)</p><h1>Stop all</h1>
<pre><code class="sh">./cluster/kubectl.sh delete service restcomm-service
./cluster/kubectl.sh delete rc restcomm-core-controller

                        <div itemprop="blogPost">
                            <p><p>Another year is gone and as you can see in the look of the blog, I have a lot of new goals for this year :-). In short, 2015 has been a quite good year, with interesting projects in Brazil, business trips to cool cities as London, Paris, Krakow, Barcelona or Lisbon. Also time to mature the team, learn new technologies and evolve our solutions. But now it&rsquo;s time to look to the future. Goals for 2016:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DevOps, DevOps, DevOps</strong>: in some way, I have been involved in DevOps all my professional life. Jumping from development to project management to system administration depending of the needs of the moment&hellip; the only things has been always there are Oracle Comms and how much I like to work with Linux, scripts, deployments and so on. I worked with Solaris Zones (precursor of Docker) and proposed to Vodafone in 2008&hellip; 8 years ago! And because of this, I&rsquo;m always more focused in development and/or product/project management: those areas are not so natural for me and there is more room for improvement. Well, this has to change. There are a lot of new stuff now related to that and I want to learn more. This will mean start to use <a href="https://github.com/aestasit/sshoogr">sshoogr</a> (Ansible-like but using Groovy), improve our Docker and Amazon AWS usage and, most important of all, integrate everything to work smoothly.</li>
  <li><strong>Groovy as center of our universe</strong>: Groovy is becoming a very important part in Oracle Comms Services Gatekeeper and Oracle Comms WebRTC Session Controller. We&rsquo;ve embraced this change, and now we are working with <a href="http://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a> for deployments and with <a href="https://github.com/spockframework/spock">Spock</a> for unit and integration testing. Also, as you can see, I have migrated the blog from Octopress to Hexo to <a href="http://www.jbake.org">JBake</a>, a blogging framework based in Java and Groovy. It&rsquo;s cool to publish your post using gradle :-)</li>
  <li><strong>Became even more fluent with Java</strong>: I have started to use Intellij Idea and learn the shortcuts, read some books as <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/netty-in-action">Netty in action</a>, made <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mobilecloudcomputing2">three Android courses</a> in Coursera and more activities. I have to continue focusing on this, it&rsquo;s not easy because most of the development I&rsquo;m able to do is out of the office in pet projects, training or peer reviews. I have been working with Java since 2007 but the only way to continue being fluent in a language is practice, practice, practice&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong>Oracle Comms and ACE</strong>: Become ACE Associate has been a great achievement. Also the participation in different events with Oracle Comms, launch this blog, write some articles, videos and other stuff. I&rsquo;m quite happy but there is still a long way&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong>Improving the team</strong>: our workflow is effective but there is a point we have to improve: it&rsquo;s quite complex for newcomers. That&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;ve started a new book in <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> titled <a href="https://leanpub.com/developmentworkflowforagileteams">Development workflow for agile teams</a> focused in our workflow. This should help to solve the gap.</li>
  <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t use the mouse</strong>: yes, I&rsquo;m a vim fan and a linux user. My goal is just stop to use the mouse for all the task I do. I feel quite confident with Intellij Idea now and the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164?pr=idea">IdeaVim</a> plugin, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/">Firefox vimperator</a> for browsing and the Linux console for most of the tasks. My main problems are with the email, calendar and some webs as Waffle and Feedly&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong>A pet project</strong>: that&rsquo;s something I have been looking for some time without luck. I would like to build something using Java/Groovy and WebRTC, working with others in something not too complex to start with / greenfield. Well, I hope 2016 is the year for this.</li>
</ul><p>That&rsquo;s all! <strong>Happy and prosperous 2016!!</strong>.</p></p>
