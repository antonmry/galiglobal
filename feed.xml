      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote a post with my goals for first time in my life. It was something new and I must say I&amp;rsquo;ve read it many times to see how things are going. It has been a good experience and I want to repeat it this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2016 year has been, in the professional aspect, the best year of my life. Probably also in the personal aspect with a new kid. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to speak too much about the last year, it was just great for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved some of the goals, failed in others, and there was new ones&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s the life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning of 2017 has been very stormy, even hard. Lots of problems, work and changes. That&amp;rsquo;s the reason I&amp;rsquo;ve waited so much to write this blog post. The good point when things are difficult is you are going to learn a lot. I have discovered things about my environment and myself which I&amp;rsquo;ve never thought about before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered is the engineers &amp;ldquo;ego problem&amp;rdquo;. When you are fighting hard to make a project success, when you solve difficult problems, when you have to make your customers understand the consequences of their decisions or you are training younger engineers&amp;hellip; Slowly but relentless the ego problem is growing on you. And let&amp;rsquo;s make this clear: I&amp;rsquo;m guilty. My motto always was: &amp;ldquo;No project where I work can&amp;rsquo;t fail&amp;rdquo;. Now I understand how wrong I was. Project can be a huge success for the customer, but a big fail for your company or the team because the lost of trustiness or the casualties.. And now I know I had some failed projects in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other good sign of this are my proposals for the last year. All of them are about me. Again, the ego problem. The reason was my fear to be out of the IT jobs market. Be without a project or a salary really scares me. I think this is irrational, I have a B plan just in case I lost my job and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find a new one. Also I&amp;rsquo;m receiving job offers every week, some of them really good ones (that does not help with the ego problem either). Probably it&amp;rsquo;s more related to spend days without to do something useful and because I feel lucky to do what I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I deserve a punishment and 2017 will be the year to start with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First goal: repeat every morning in front of the mirror &amp;ldquo;Be humble&amp;rdquo; three times. If in some point of the day I fail on that, I will go to the involved person and I will ask for forgiveness. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it&amp;rsquo;s a small fail or the involved person is a jerk, I will do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second goal: make the company where I work a better place to work. This means stop claiming and start to actively work in the solution to solve the problems I&amp;rsquo;m claiming about. Let&amp;rsquo;s make this clear: companies must earn money. But at the same time, employees must be feel involved, happy and positive. Both things are related. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to do this or the real impact which I can have with my actions in a big company. I&amp;rsquo;m just one, I&amp;rsquo;m not a superhero and the company where I work is really good but there is always groom for improvement. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter my role, I will just try to do as much as possible. Also I want to focus in the youngest engineers. In my opinion senior engineers should be more involved in professional evolution of the younger ones and I want to lead by example on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third goal: return something to your local community. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe this is a goal I have when I&amp;rsquo;m 36 years old. Start so late on this is probably the biggest failure in my career. It was even more clear to me after an event last week for students. Two of the speakers made great points on the importance of contribute to your local community. I admire those two guys. I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be like them but at least I want to do something. Start the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Vigo-JUG/&quot;&gt;VigoJUG&lt;/a&gt; is a beginning. I hope to find other ways to contribute during the year. If you are reading this and you have any idea, please, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last goal isn&amp;rsquo;t really a goal but a fear. Yesterday a fellow said I&amp;rsquo;m a Project Manager. It has been very painful for me because I realize he was partially right and I don&amp;rsquo;t want that role anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.amuniversal.com/07b853c0c94f013441df005056a9545d&quot; alt=&quot;Dilbert Has Management Potential&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing a lot but 2017 has been crazy and I&amp;rsquo;ve been more focused in solve problems and get things done&amp;hellip; So my technical work has been reduced to Pull Request reviews and some time developing in the weekend. Rest of the time: mails, phone calls, write documents and meetings. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend the rest of my life doing only those things. I know they are useful and they are the way to achieve the goals I&amp;rsquo;ve described before. But I&amp;rsquo;ve spent 20 years of my life dealing with computers, I&amp;rsquo;ve trained myself to learn vim shortcuts, researching how to write clean code, use the command shell, etc. and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to loose that. It makes me feel happy and full. If I don&amp;rsquo;t do it, I will end being sad and frustrated, so I have to found a way to conciliate both things. Any advise will be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to finish this post asking for forgiveness. Specially during my time in Accenture I did a lot of wrong things. Not even close but I pushed too hard some times in Optare. If I did something which has troubled you, I&amp;rsquo;m very sorry. I promise: I will be humble, I will be humble, I will be humble.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developing in RestComm? Docker to the rescue </title>
      <link>http://www.galiglobal.com/blog/2016/20160508-Developing-in-RestComm-Docker-to-the-rescue.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 8 May 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2016/20160508-Developing-in-RestComm-Docker-to-the-rescue.html</guid>
      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a RestComm expert but I like to document the steps when I do something. It&amp;rsquo;s quite schematic but yet, it may help someone. Start to contribute to RestComm is really hard because the lack of documentation and all the team very busy. But it&amp;rsquo;s a interesting project and a nice community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is quite simple: show how how create two PRs: one for Restcomm-Docker, another for Restcomm-Connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Java 7 development environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ant and maven&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is the first step to become a RestComm maniac?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Download the source code&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easy part, I love github:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;git clone git@github.com:antonmry/Restcomm-Connect.git
git clone git@github.com:antonmry/Restcomm-Docker.git
cd Restcomm-Docker/
git remote add upstream git@github.com:RestComm/Restcomm-Docker.git
cd ../Restcomm-Connect/
git remote add upstream git@github.com:RestComm/Restcomm-Connect.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve done it previously, it&amp;rsquo;s a good moment to sync with the official respository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;RestComm-Docker&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we are going to set up the RestComm environment: docker to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always create a local branch to do my work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;cd ../Restcomm-Docker/
git checkout -b s3bucketRegion#1
git push -u origin s3bucketRegion#1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;docker build -t restcomm/yourname:latest -f Dockerfile .

docker run -i -d -v /var/log/restcomm/:/var/log/restcomm/ -e VOICERSS_KEY=&amp;quot;CREATE A NEW ONE&amp;quot; -e S3_ACCESS_KEY=&amp;quot;ONLY IF YOU USE IT&amp;quot; -e S3_SECURITY_KEY=&amp;quot;ONLY IF YOU USE IT&amp;quot; -e S3_BUCKET_NAME=&amp;quot;ONLY IF YOU USE IT&amp;quot; -e STATIC_ADDRESS=&amp;quot;YOUR ETH0 IP?&amp;quot; -e ENVCONFURL=&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RestComm/Restcomm-Docker/master/scripts/restcomm_env_locally.sh&amp;quot; -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 9990:9990 -p 5060:5060 -p 5061:5061 -p 5062:5062 -p 5063:5063 -p 5060:5060/udp -p 65000-65050:65000-65050/udp restcomm/yourname:latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &amp;ldquo;enter&amp;rdquo; inside the docker instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;docker ps
docker exec -it bfed9c0195f51c089b5edc001e48c31f4fb374a90a781f02f9c514a691fa6933 /bin/bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To copy the deployments folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;cd /opt/Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments/
tar -cvf /tmp/deployments.tar *
exit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPLACE_WITH_READ_MORE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We leave the container and extract the deployment folder in your system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;docker cp bfed9c0195f51c089b5edc001e48c31f4fb374a90a781f02f9c514a691fa6933:/tmp/deployments.tar .
mkdir deployments 
mv deployments.tar deployments
rm deployments.tar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launch docker with the new folder as its deployment folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;docker stop bfed9c0195f51c089b5edc001e48c31f4fb374a90a781f02f9c514a691fa6933

docker run -i -d -v /var/log/restcomm/:/var/log/restcomm/ -v /home/antonmry/Workspace/Telestax/deployments:/opt/Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments -e VOICERSS_KEY=&amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot; -e S3_ACCESS_KEY=&amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot; -e S3_SECURITY_KEY=&amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot; -e S3_BUCKET_NAME=&amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot; -e STATIC_ADDRESS=&amp;quot;your eth0 IP?&amp;quot; -e ENVCONFURL=&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RestComm/Restcomm-Docker/master/scripts/restcomm_env_locally.sh&amp;quot; -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 9990:9990 -p 5060:5060 -p 5061:5061 -p 5062:5062 -p 5063:5063 -p 5060:5060/udp -p 65000-65050:65000-65050/udp restcomm/yourname:latest

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to make your changes in the Dockerfile. Once they are done, build the image and test. To upload it to github, first upload to your repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;git add file1 file2
git commit -m &amp;quot;Descriptive message please&amp;quot;
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In github, open a Request using as Base the official repository and as a Head Fork your branch. Usually I add a &amp;ldquo;Closes #xx&amp;rdquo; to the end of the title, where xx is the number of the issue you are solving. It helps if you are using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waffle.io&quot;&gt;Waffle&lt;/a&gt;, a great service to organize your issues following agile methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;RestComm-Connect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, we have our Restcomm-docker PR, let&amp;rsquo;s got with ResComm-Connect. First you need to create a file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;cd ../Restcomm-Connect/
vim restcomm-connect-build.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;with the following content (change to your own values):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash
export RESTCOMM_HOME=/home/antonmry/Workspace/Telestax/Restcomm-Connect
export MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER=7.6
export BUILD_NUMBER=0

JAVA_HOME=/home/antonmry/Software/jdk/jdk1.7.0_80
export JAVA_HOME

export WORKSPACE=$RESTCOMM_HOME
mkdir $WORKSPACE/dependencies
export DEPENDENCIES_HOME=$WORKSPACE/dependencies

ant release -f ./release/build.xml -Drestcomm.release.version=$MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER.$BUILD_NUMBER -Drestcomm.branch.name=restcomm-release-$MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER.$BUILD_NUMBER -Dcheckout.restcomm.dir=$RESTCOMM_HOME -Dworkspace.restcomm.dir=$RESTCOMM_HOME/restcomm -Dcheckout.dir=$DEPENDENCIES_HOME
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Execute it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;chmod +x restcomm-connect-build.sh
./restcomm-connect-build.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to wait 5 minutes in a good laptop&amp;hellip; after that, we should have our customozied JBoss ready to be launched: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;ls ./release/Restcomm-JBoss-AS7-7.6.0.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can unzip it and start to play with it&amp;hellip; but how to start to develop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Intellij Idea, you can import the project as a Maven project. I&amp;rsquo;ve imported the route &lt;strong&gt;Restcomm-Connect/restcomm&lt;/strong&gt; which has the root pom.xml and created a local branch as usual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;git checkout -b initTimeRVD#1
git push -u origin initTimeRVD#1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can develop as much as you want. To build it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;cd restcomm
mvn install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you can do it with the different modules, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to build everything each time but the specific module you&amp;rsquo;ve changed. To deploy it and test it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;docker ps
docker stop 06b117547bc5726fc74c42a61c6826342f04b9b194ebc0029f70be4ad1ef1a4f
rm -r /home/antonmry/Workspace/Telestax/deployments/restcomm.war
rm -r /home/antonmry/Workspace/Telestax/deployments/restcomm-rvd.war
cp -r restcomm.application/target/restcomm/ ~/Workspace/Telestax/deployments/restcomm.war
cp -r restcomm.application/target/restcomm.rvd/ ~/Workspace/Telestax/deployments/restcomm-rvd.war
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;docker run -i -d -v /var/log/restcomm/:/var/log/restcomm/ -v /home/antonmry/Workspace/Telestax/deployments:/opt/Restcomm-JBoss-AS7/standalone/deployments -e VOICERSS_KEY=&amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot; -e S3_ACCESS_KEY=&amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot; -e S3_SECURITY_KEY=&amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot; -e S3_BUCKET_NAME=&amp;quot;xxx&amp;quot; -e STATIC_ADDRESS=&amp;quot;YOUR ETH0 IP?&amp;quot; -e ENVCONFURL=&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RestComm/Restcomm-Docker/master/scripts/restcomm_env_locally.sh&amp;quot; -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 9990:9990 -p 5060:5060 -p 5061:5061 -p 5062:5062 -p 5063:5063 -p 5060:5060/udp -p 65000-65050:65000-65050/udp restcomm/yourname:latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know, just open RestComm as usual in &lt;a href=&quot;https://eth0-ip&quot;&gt;https://eth0-ip&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://eth0-ip/olympus&quot;&gt;https://eth0-ip/olympus&lt;/a&gt; and test. Once you have finished your changes, upload them to Github:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;git add file1 file2
git commit &amp;quot;A good message #yourIssue&amp;quot;
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create the PR in github and wait for the approbation ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Reference documentation&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>First year as ACE Associate and 2016 goals</title>
      <link>http://www.galiglobal.com/blog/2016/20160102-First-year-as-ACE-Associate-and-2016-goals.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 2 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2016/20160102-First-year-as-ACE-Associate-and-2016-goals.html</guid>
      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;Another year is gone and as you can see in the look of the blog, I have a lot of new goals for this year :-). In short, 2015 has been a quite good year, with interesting projects in Brazil, business trips to cool cities as London, Paris, Krakow, Barcelona or Lisbon. Also time to mature the team, learn new technologies and evolve our solutions. But now it&amp;rsquo;s time to look to the future. Goals for 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevOps, DevOps, DevOps&lt;/strong&gt;: in some way, I have been involved in DevOps all my professional life. Jumping from development to project management to system administration depending of the needs of the moment&amp;hellip; the only things has been always there are Oracle Comms and how much I like to work with Linux, scripts, deployments and so on. I worked with Solaris Zones (precursor of Docker) and proposed to Vodafone in 2008&amp;hellip; 8 years ago! And because of this, I&amp;rsquo;m always more focused in development and/or product/project management: those areas are not so natural for me and there is more room for improvement. Well, this has to change. There are a lot of new stuff now related to that and I want to learn more. This will mean start to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aestasit/sshoogr&quot;&gt;sshoogr&lt;/a&gt; (Ansible-like but using Groovy), improve our Docker and Amazon AWS usage and, most important of all, integrate everything to work smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groovy as center of our universe&lt;/strong&gt;: Groovy is becoming a very important part in Oracle Comms Services Gatekeeper and Oracle Comms WebRTC Session Controller. We&amp;rsquo;ve embraced this change, and now we are working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradle.org&quot;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; for deployments and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spockframework/spock&quot;&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt; for unit and integration testing. Also, as you can see, I have migrated the blog from Octopress to Hexo to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbake.org&quot;&gt;JBake&lt;/a&gt;, a blogging framework based in Java and Groovy. It&amp;rsquo;s cool to publish your post using gradle :-)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Became even more fluent with Java&lt;/strong&gt;: I have started to use Intellij Idea and learn the shortcuts, read some books as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manning.com/books/netty-in-action&quot;&gt;Netty in action&lt;/a&gt;, made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mobilecloudcomputing2&quot;&gt;three Android courses&lt;/a&gt; in Coursera and more activities. I have to continue focusing on this, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy because most of the development I&amp;rsquo;m able to do is out of the office in pet projects, training or peer reviews. I have been working with Java since 2007 but the only way to continue being fluent in a language is practice, practice, practice&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oracle Comms and ACE&lt;/strong&gt;: Become ACE Associate has been a great achievement. Also the participation in different events with Oracle Comms, launch this blog, write some articles, videos and other stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy but there is still a long way&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving the team&lt;/strong&gt;: our workflow is effective but there is a point we have to improve: it&amp;rsquo;s quite complex for newcomers. That&amp;rsquo;s the reason I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new book in &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com&quot;&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/developmentworkflowforagileteams&quot;&gt;Development workflow for agile teams&lt;/a&gt; focused in our workflow. This should help to solve the gap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use the mouse&lt;/strong&gt;: yes, I&amp;rsquo;m a vim fan and a linux user. My goal is just stop to use the mouse for all the task I do. I feel quite confident with Intellij Idea now and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164?pr=idea&quot;&gt;IdeaVim&lt;/a&gt; plugin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/&quot;&gt;Firefox vimperator&lt;/a&gt; for browsing and the Linux console for most of the tasks. My main problems are with the email, calendar and some webs as Waffle and Feedly&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pet project&lt;/strong&gt;: that&amp;rsquo;s something I have been looking for some time without luck. I would like to build something using Java/Groovy and WebRTC, working with others in something not too complex to start with / greenfield. Well, I hope 2016 is the year for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all! &lt;strong&gt;Happy and prosperous 2016!!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This is the continuation of how to install and test OCSG, you can find the part 1 &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible-Part-1.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Platform Test Environment (PTE) Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Login to &lt;a href=&quot;https://edelivery.oracle.com/&quot;&gt;Oracle Software Delivery Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, choose &lt;em&gt;Oracle Communications&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Select a Product Pack&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Linux x86-64&lt;/em&gt; and click on &lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt;. Click on &lt;em&gt;Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper 6.0&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper 6.0 Platform Test Environment, V73999-01.zip and copy it into the VM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unzip the file and execute the installer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;unzip V73999-01.zip

Review the Installation Summary and press &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;. It may take a while. Press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; when available and &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/installationPTEDone.png&quot; alt=&quot;PTE Installation Done&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start the PTE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open a new Terminal and execute the following commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;cd /opt/ocsg6/ocsg_pte/
./run.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The PTE should appear:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/PTE.png&quot; alt=&quot;The PTE&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Tools -&amp;gt; Variables Manager&lt;/strong&gt; or press &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl+3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/VariablesManagerMenu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Variables Manager Menu&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the globe icon with a green arrow pointing up and press &lt;strong&gt;Local&lt;/strong&gt;. The message &lt;em&gt;The SLA was succesfully uploaded to OCSG&lt;/em&gt; should appear. Press &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt; twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/default_app_group_done.png&quot; alt=&quot;Default App Group SLA Done&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;default_sp_group&lt;/strong&gt; and click on the pencil icon. Click on the globe icon with a up arrow and press &lt;strong&gt;Local&lt;/strong&gt;. The message &lt;em&gt;The SLA was succesfully uploaded to OCSG&lt;/em&gt; should appear. Press &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt; twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Simulators -&amp;gt; SMPP&lt;/strong&gt; and click on &lt;strong&gt;Start&lt;/strong&gt;. The button will change to &lt;strong&gt;Stop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/SMPPSimulator.png&quot; alt=&quot;SMPP Simulator&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final test: send SMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the PTE, go to &lt;strong&gt;Clients -&amp;gt; Login&lt;/strong&gt; and press &lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt; (green arrow). The button should change to &lt;strong&gt;Logout&lt;/strong&gt; (red square).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Client Login&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Messaging -&amp;gt; Short Messaging -&amp;gt; Application-initiated&lt;/strong&gt; and change the message to &lt;em&gt;Hello SaNE!&lt;/em&gt;. Click on &lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt; (green arrow).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/sendSMS.png&quot; alt=&quot;Send SMS&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the &lt;strong&gt;Map&lt;/strong&gt;, click on the second button over the phone &lt;strong&gt;1234&lt;/strong&gt; and choose &lt;em&gt;Read messages&lt;/em&gt;. Here it is!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/SMS.png&quot; alt=&quot;SMS Sent&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably you have spent more than fifteen minutes to arrive here&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s also true most of the actions are part of the configuration, not the installation. The process is straightforward and it can be easily explained. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have advanced knowledge of Weblogic or Linux, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to do it. So, as we can see in this article, OCSG is very easy to install now and it has a lot of features deployed out-of-the-box. Because it&amp;rsquo;s a so extensive application supporting a huge number of business possibilities (Service API Exposure, Direct Carrier Billing, Policy Gateway, etc. ), a basic fresh installation is a very powerful way to focus in the functionality and forget problems with databases, OS and other technical questions and now we can have it in only 15 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We are TADHack 2015 winners :-)</title>
      <link>http://www.galiglobal.com/blog/2015/We-are-TADHack-2015-winners.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2015/We-are-TADHack-2015-winners.html</guid>
      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;Without any type of doubt, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tadhack.com&quot;&gt;TADHack&lt;/a&gt; is my favourite event in the year. Mainly because of three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Excellent collaborative atmosphere and lots of friends. I love to have the opportunity to share some time with people involved in the same topics I&amp;rsquo;m working with. And not only that, it&amp;rsquo;s full of techies :-)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Event is well managed by Alan Quayle and his team. Everything goes smoothly and you are always busy speaking, developing, visiting other vendors or watching other hacks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not too big, so you have the chance to have a chat with almost everybody&amp;hellip; this seems weird but when I&amp;rsquo;m participating in bigger events, I&amp;rsquo;ve the feeling I don&amp;rsquo;t have time enough to speak with all people I would like to speak with. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in TADHack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;My participation in this event is mainly because we are running and providing support for the Oracle Comms environment, there is a web with information about all the resources in case you are interested: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com&quot;&gt;http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com&lt;/a&gt;. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s the second year we are doing it, the installation of the three Oracle SDP products it&amp;rsquo;s not straightforward. We had to update to the last versions of the products and we are always looking for ways to improve it. It&amp;rsquo;s not a secret we are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; to support this infrastructure. Some day I have to write a post about the whole infrastructure and how we are using AWS to support the service. The part about how we upload the VMs to AWS EC2 is quite awesome and tricky because some of them are based in customized Linux versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting things this year was the opportunity to participate as developers. Obviously we cannot be winners of the Oracle prize, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fair, but we can combine the Oracle environment with other sponsors, in this case we chose Intel providing an embedded board. Also we have a new member in the NetApps team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonathrodriguez&quot;&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;, who is a great Java and Android developer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgYdT9Q7OWw&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s the video where he&amp;rsquo;s showing the hack in Lisbon:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgYdT9Q7OWw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now the big news&amp;hellip; we won!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Heart Rate Monitor team, winners of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Inteliot&quot;&gt;@Inteliot&lt;/a&gt; prize at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TADHack&quot;&gt;@TADHack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antonmry&quot;&gt;@antonmry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/iPbWtemQ25&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iPbWtemQ25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alan Quayle (@Alan_Quayle) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Alan_Quayle/status/610618140918157313&quot;&gt;June 16, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see my big smile in the photo. I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy being one of the winners. I guess I always have been a bit jealous of the others developers :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, TADHack 2015 has been great and bigger than the 2014 edition. The TAD ecosystem is evolving very quick and I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to see how this evolves in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A look back to Geecon 2015</title>
      <link>http://www.galiglobal.com/blog/2015/A-look-back-to-Geecon-2015.html</link>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2015/A-look-back-to-Geecon-2015.html</guid>
      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been invited by Oracle Comms to join &lt;a href=&quot;http://2015.geecon.org/speakers/info.html?id=70&quot;&gt;Geecon 2015&lt;/a&gt; to speak about Web Real Time Commutations – Voice, Video, and Data Communications with my good friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait&quot;&gt;Douglas Tait&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s always a pleasure to work with someone as Doug and his feedback about previous editions was really good, so I was more than happy to participate in this event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I joined the event, I quickly realized Doug was right. There are all things you can expect from a developer event but mixed with a lot of fun things. Everybody is really friendly, organizers made a huge effort to make everybody feel really well. There are a lot of jokes. I really like the speakers hats, even if my head is too big for them, I know, it&amp;rsquo;s my fault ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was more impressed with it&amp;rsquo;s the place itself. It&amp;rsquo;s a commercial cinema in Krakow. So everyday when the event ends, movies start. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome. The place is perfect for conferences: great sound, great screen, comfortable chairs, etc. At the same time, it should be easy to book it, most of the cinemas are empty now, at least in Spain. It&amp;rsquo;s a great idea and a good example of how Geecon organizers are able to think out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing I really enjoyed it was the attendees. They were very participative, making good questions, proposing new ideas. In one of the conferences, even helped the speaker with some IntelliJ Idea shortcuts, really cool! With our talk it wasn&amp;rsquo;t different, they made a lot of questions and we finished speaking with a lot of them. For something so specific as WebRTC and communications, it was great to see some people really interested on it. I have been always jealous of the Java ecosystem in relation to the TAD ecosystem, even with the great help of TADHack, there is a big gap yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our talk was about how Java helps in communications, with focus on WebRTC, SIP and Telecom APIs. People was more interested in WebRTC than any other subject. We run some demos, show some code and made some jokes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/131761796&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s the video recorded by the Geecon organizers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/131761796&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/131761796&quot;&gt;GeeCON 2015: Ant&amp;oacute;n Yuste, Douglas Tait - Web Real Time Commutations &amp;ndash; Voice, Video, and Data Communications&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/geecon&quot;&gt;GeeCON Conference&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really would like to repeat next year. This is one of the best events where I had the opportunity to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Some days ago I had the opportunity to do a interview for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmcnet.com&quot;&gt;TMCnet&lt;/a&gt; with Peter Bernstein. It was a fun experience and it&amp;rsquo;s great to have time to speak about WebRTC, Hackathons and Oracle Communications.

      <title>The Oracle ACE Associate award</title>
      <link>http://www.galiglobal.com/blog/2015/The-Oracle-ACE-Associate-award.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2015/The-Oracle-ACE-Associate-award.html</guid>
      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been awarded as &lt;a href=&quot;https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=19297:4:::NO:4:P4_ID:12240&quot;&gt;Oracle ACE Associate&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve earned something like that so I&amp;rsquo;m very proud and happy. It&amp;rsquo;s not a secret I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Oracle Comms since 2007 but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until last year I started to be more active in social networks, writing articles and attending conferences. I should have started to do it sooner but it&amp;rsquo;s not so easy, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t until now I really know my desired professional path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/About-me/O_ACE_Icon_blk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Oracle ACE Associate&quot;&quot;/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me explain the different reasons because this award is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Optare Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optare is a great company full of potential ACEs. I remember RittmanMead (a similar company in the BI space) and how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rittmanmead.com/2014/12/six-months-an-ace/&quot;&gt;they promote their workers to became Oracle ACE and participate in technical conferences&lt;/a&gt;. I know how important is this type of activities. Things like that provide a more clear professional path, increase the visibility of the company (hey! They have 5 Orace ACE and 1 Oracle ACE Director) and, even more important, it helps to identify and retain talented people. I am the first Oracle ACE Associate in Optare. I hope this is only the beginning. There are really good Oracle consultants and developers in the company, so the most important thing (the know-how) is not going to be the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Communications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Oracle Comms is quite big after the adquisitions of ACME and Tekelec, the OTN community is quite inactive. For example, the last OTN article published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/communications/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; it was in 2005, and not, the solution isn&amp;rsquo;t close the section!. I would like to see a more active community and that was the reason of my Oracle ACE Associate submission. I know it&amp;rsquo;s a big task and it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to achieve it alone but there are some people inside Oracle working in this direction and I am quite positive. A probe of that is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tadhack.com&quot;&gt;TADHack&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/&quot;&gt;Oracle Sandbox&lt;/a&gt; promoted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait&quot;&gt;Douglas Tait&lt;/a&gt;, he&amp;rsquo;s doing a great job building a developers community. I am sure we&amp;rsquo;ll see important updates in the following months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone likes to receive awards and I am not different. But more important, it&amp;rsquo;s a good sign about how I am doing things right now. In the end of 2012, I left Accenture and my work as Project Manager. I returned to Optare Solutions and it&amp;rsquo;s a decision I don&amp;rsquo;t regret. But I&amp;rsquo;ve to paid the fee: stop my career as manager and back to be a technical guy. Being an IT worker in Spain is never more a professional suicide. There are some cool companies as Optare Solutions and Quobis, or you can work remotely for foreign companies. All you have to do is to be a good engineer and speak English well. That&amp;rsquo;s the reason because Oracle ACE Associate is important to me: it probes both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other important point, Oracle ACE Associate gives me access to some cool resources and the possibility to speak in technical conferences. I really appreciate that right now. And, of course, I have some cool Oracle stuff now :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A nice gift waiting for me in the office... thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/oracleace&quot;&gt;@oracleace&lt;/a&gt;!

      &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I will be travelling to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.com/2015/&quot;&gt;TADHack&lt;/a&gt; in Lisbon and I am so excited! It&amp;rsquo;s going to be great! As part of the initiatives we&amp;rsquo;ve done to promote &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/&quot;&gt;the Oracle sandbox&lt;/a&gt; and help the developers, I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded three videos to introduce the three Oracle SDP applications. Even if they are oriented to the TADHack, they are a good resource for anyone interested in the products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this video, we are going to introduce Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller and how to use it to add audio, video and data communications to web and mobile applications. It provides an introduction to a sample application, a good starting point to develop more complex services. It ends explaining how to add a widget which allows developers to add Real-time communication in a very easy way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBUyris2GUA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Communications Service Gatekeeper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this video, we are going to introduce the Telecom APIs available in the Oracle Communications sandbox: Messaging, Payment and Location. Developers will learn how to start to work with those APIs and how to add them to their own applications and hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6W3Dpx4Rsc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Communications Converged Application Server&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this video, we are going to introduce Oracle Communications Converged Application Server and how to design and build applications able to manage HTTP and SIP protocols at the same time. We&amp;rsquo;ll review also the new SIP Servlet 2.0 specification and the JSR-359 recently approved. We&amp;rsquo;ll end the video reviewing a B2BUA application and learning to modify it to build more complex applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/50fZ1-3dpnE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;ve started this blog, my main motivation was to provide a central place with information about Service Delivery Platforms, mainly related to the Oracle Communication suite because it&amp;rsquo;s what I know. But I am failing in this goal. I am very busy from the beginning of the year and I don&amp;rsquo;t find time enough to write posts and articles. Excuses. I should keep in mind the original idea and don&amp;rsquo;t miss the opportunity to keep readers updated with the last news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this post is going to be a summary of the releases and news in the Oracle Comms SDP&amp;hellip;. and there are a lot!. Even a new product!. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper (aka Gatekeeper)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about the new 6.0 version &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/23/OCSG-6-0v1-generally-available-new-features-introduction/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and even I&amp;rsquo;ve published &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/30/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible-Part-1/&quot;&gt;the first part of a how-to explaining the installation&lt;/a&gt;. But there are two very interesting updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper 6.0 Patch Set 1 Released&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New patch solving more than 20 bugs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=447946421774684&amp;id=1993751.1&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=1de1letpct_4&quot;&gt;Doc ID 1993751.1&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever you are doing with OCSG, the installation of this patch should be mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides also patches for JDK &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/patch/PatchDetail.jspx?parent=DOCUMENT&amp;sourceId=1993751.1&amp;patchId=20347164&quot;&gt;Patch 20347164&lt;/a&gt;, Weblogic &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/patch/PatchDetail.jspx?parent=DOCUMENT&amp;sourceId=1993751.1&amp;patchId=19637454&quot;&gt;Patch 19637454&lt;/a&gt; and Coherence &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/patch/PatchDetail.jspx?parent=DOCUMENT&amp;sourceId=1993751.1&amp;patchId=20164069&quot;&gt;Patch 20164069&lt;/a&gt;, be sure to apply them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper Statement of Direction - May 2015&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle has published recently a SoD for OCSG. It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to know what Oracle is working on. Here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=448644669159009&amp;id=1081178.1&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=1de1letpct_78&quot;&gt;Doc ID 1081178.1&lt;/a&gt;, you can find it. The document deserves a special post for it!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Oracle Communications Application Server (aka OCCAS)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new version for our favorite AS&amp;hellip; from 5.1 to 7.0. A lot of new changes!. The most important item, it&amp;rsquo;s the first implementation of the recently released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=359&quot;&gt;JSR 359: SIP Servlet 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. There are also other things, for instance, new (and more modern!) versions of the JDK and Weblogic. This is not a release with a lot of new features but with a lot of improvements for developers. Here it&amp;rsquo;s the announcement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle Communications Converged Application Server (OCCAS) 7.0 release is now available to customers/partners for download. OCCAS 7.0 is the industry’s first JSR 359 (SIP Servlet 2.0) compliant SIP Application Server/Communications Middleware based on Java EE 6/Java EE 7. OCCAS 7.0 also introduces Coherence based in-memory, distributed cache data architecture that enables the customers to dynamically scale mission-critical applications. OCCAS 7.0 also introduces a flexible overload framework and monitoring functions which along with the auto scaling capabilities makes it Cloud/NFV ready. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some key capabilities of the release:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** SIP Servlet 2.0/ JSR 359 Compliance **&lt;br/&gt; * Makes SIP Servlet Development more agile (Java EE 6/7, CDI, POJOs, Annotations etc)&lt;br/&gt; * Meets most demanding requirements of communications middleware (Converged container, abstraction, portability, standards compliance etc)&lt;br/&gt; * Fosters decentralized ecosystem (Extensibility, Pluggability etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Coherence based data architecture **&lt;br/&gt; * Elasticity – Scale in/out&lt;br/&gt; * Reliability/fault tolerance/HA&lt;br/&gt; * Performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Monitoring and Overload Protection **&lt;br/&gt; * Overload Framework/ Custom KPI policies and threshold configuration&lt;br/&gt; * Memory Based Overload Protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Enhanced Diameter Support **&lt;br/&gt; * SIP Application Interworking with Diameter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Virtualization Technologies Support **&lt;br/&gt; * OVM &amp;amp; KVM Certification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Platform Upgrade **&lt;br/&gt; * Based on WebLogic 12.1.3 (latest release)&lt;/p&gt;

Bugs fixed and some interesting features as invoke REST interfaces from the Groovy scripts or some improvements in the registrar. Check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E55119_01/doc.71/e55133/toc.htm&quot;&gt;Release note&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;iOS SDK and Android SDK finally available&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently the SDKs for Android and iOS have been published. You can find them &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/webrtc-2525637.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also there are some excellent how-to wrote by Leif Lourie &lt;a href=&quot;https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:2:109737384896297:::2,CIR,RIR:P2_PRODUCT_ID,P2_RELEASE_ID:3479&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, great work from Leif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Oracle Communications Evolved Communications Application Server (aka eCAS)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important news for the end: a new product based in OCCAS. Here the note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mobile operators drive their networks toward an all-IP and virtualized state, they require the means to design and deliver compelling high definition voice, video and multimedia offers via Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Oracle Communications Evolved Communications Application Server (OCECAS) brings a sophisticated, yet easy-to-use network service design and delivery product to satisfy that need. OCECAS works out of the box; it is NFV-enabled and standards compliant; and it provides network-grade speed and reliability with the cost profile of an IT product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond service delivery, OCECAS accelerates the operator&amp;rsquo;s move to better network cost performance by driving subscribers to offers that engage IP assets, allowing the operator to retire more traditional components. This drive toward the single IP network also facilitates spectrum reuse for increased monetization opportunity. OCECAS is a significant step forward in the journey to the all-IP, virtualized network destination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operators will also enjoy lower service update costs as the flexible user interface allows service changes to be implemented without costly, time-consuming software coding or vendor customizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oracle Communications Evolved Communications Application Server includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Key Capabilities **&lt;br/&gt;- Out of the box VoLTE and VoWiFi application designed for GSMA standards for immediate productivity&lt;br/&gt;- Built from the ground up to support NFV&lt;br/&gt;- Standards-compliant IMS interfaces built with SIP, Diameter and Java&lt;br/&gt;- Easy to use, yet powerful session design center providing intuitive drag and drop application configuration&lt;br/&gt;- Continuous design-time validation enforcement and version control to ensure quality&lt;br/&gt;- Automated deployment across testing, staging and production environments&lt;br/&gt;- Flexible data federation across multiple sources to prevent costly custom integrations&lt;br/&gt;- Productized integration with Oracle Communications Core Session Manager (OCCSM)&lt;br/&gt;- Runtime powered by the Oracle Communications Converged Application Server (OCCAS) 7.0&lt;br/&gt;- Interoperability testing underway with Radisys and Dialogic Media Resource Functions&lt;br/&gt;- Integration of inbound third-party services, enabling differentiated offers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Benefits **&lt;br/&gt;- Productive from the first day&lt;br/&gt;- Delivers true service agility for improved time to market&lt;br/&gt;- Enables attractive, differentiated offer creation&lt;br/&gt;- Freedom from vendor-specific customizations&lt;br/&gt;- Virtualized, interoperable, standards-compliant&lt;br/&gt;- Robust, network-grade operation on industry-standard platforms&lt;br/&gt;- Low TCO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-913067?sr=inbox&amp;ru=831131&quot;&gt;Oracle Community&lt;/a&gt; and also check the Press note &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/2526355?rssid=rss_ocom_pr&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eventreg.oracle.com/profile/web/index.cfm?PKwebID=0x22479021e2&amp;varPage=home&quot;&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;, don&amp;rsquo;t miss it if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me it&amp;rsquo;s really good to have a release like this. Being OCCAS based, it&amp;rsquo;s very easy for us to learn the new product and there are some interesting integration with ACME products. I will build a laboratory very soon and I hope to find time to write more about this new product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tunned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SpringIO 2015: a great event for a great community</title>

      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to participate in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springio.net/using-groovy-to-empower-webrtc-network-systems/&quot;&gt;SpringIO as speaker&lt;/a&gt; in April (Barcelona). It was quite scary to participate in a conference about Spring, I am not a web developer, and, in fact, when I have to develop or design any web system based in Java, I prefer just to use EJB3 and Servlet 3.2, avoiding any framework. But there is something more in this conference: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_%28programming_language%29&quot;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt;. And we are using Groovy in a lot of cool things, specially in the WebRTC domain. So the idea was simple: introduce WebRTC and show an interesting Groovy use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Groovy is not in a good moment right now. Yes, there are a lot of people speaking about it&amp;hellip; but after Strachan (Groovy&amp;rsquo;s creator) wrote on his blog, &amp;ldquo;I can honestly say if someone had shown me the Programming in Scala book by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon &amp;amp; Bill Venners back in 2003 I&amp;rsquo;d probably have never created Groovy.&amp;rdquo; and Pivotal is not hosting the project any more&amp;hellip; well, uncertain future for Groovy&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s a pity. Because sometimes we need a scripting language and Groovy is a great choice if you are a Java developer, as I am. It&amp;rsquo;s dynamically compiled to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode, so the performance is good, even for network system. Also it can interoperate with other Java code and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, I would like to see Oracle more involved in the Groovy project, for instance reviving the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=241&quot;&gt;JSR-241&lt;/a&gt; and ending with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython&quot;&gt;jython&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; If you are working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E29542_01/nav/wlst.htm&quot;&gt;Weblogic Scripting Tool (WLST)&lt;/a&gt;, you probably hate Jython as much I do. Other important point is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradle.org/&quot;&gt;gradle&lt;/a&gt;, it looks a great tool even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have opportunity to test it yet. Anyway, I am quite happy with Maven, specially now with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/entry/weblogic_server_and_the_oracle&quot;&gt;new Maven Oracle Repository&lt;/a&gt;. And I have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/spock/&quot;&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt; in the &amp;ldquo;thing to review&amp;rdquo; list, a testing framework also based in Groovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if my talk wasn&amp;rsquo;t successful and my interest in the Spring framework is limited, I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed the event. First, because it was very well organized. Second, the quality of the speakers was awesome, the technical quality of some talks was superb. And not only because of the speakers, also because of the audience. I envy Spring having a so good community, it would we so great to have something similar with Telecom Application Developers. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons because I&amp;rsquo;m so excited with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.com/2015/&quot;&gt;TADHack&lt;/a&gt; and all the work &lt;a href=&quot;http://alanquayle.com&quot;&gt;Alan Quayle&lt;/a&gt; is doing. It is a long road yet but a good start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here my slides. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered WebRTC, then Groovy and I&amp;rsquo;ve finished with some TADHack references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/bKBppeBAK8rQze&quot; width=&quot;476&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a project in GitHub with the source code if you are interested: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/antonmry/SpringIOWebRTCSampleApp&quot;&gt;SpringIOWebRTCSampleApp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Oracle Communications &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Services Gatekeeper 6&lt;/a&gt;, the industry-leading API exposure platform, is Generally Available and with many new and interesting features. One of them is the simplified configuration and deployment with installation in 15 minutes, based on lightweight single tier deployment option. I really like the idea, it&amp;rsquo;s going to help with Proofs of Concept and Training. So in this article, I am going to review this feature: a fight against the clock to know how many time an OCSG student needs to deploy OCSG. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/StandaloneOCSG6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Services Gatekeeper Standalone System&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: some steps shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be executed in production environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preparations Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As good practice, the first step is always check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e50756/ins_sysreq.htm#SGINS122&quot;&gt;Supported Platform Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. For this installation, we have the following pre-requisites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oracle Linux 6: in this case, it is version 6.6 x64, you can download it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://edelivery.oracle.com/linux&quot;&gt;Oracle Software Delivery Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. It may run hosted in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Virtualbox environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JDK 1.7 installed: in this case, Java SE Development Kit 7u75 for Linux x64 (tgz). You can download it from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Java SE Development Kit 7 Downloads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access as root user and also as oracle user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;OCSG installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Login to &lt;a href=&quot;https://edelivery.oracle.com/&quot;&gt;Oracle Software Delivery Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, choose &lt;em&gt;Oracle Communications&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Select a Product Pack&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Linux x86-64&lt;/em&gt; and click on &lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;em&gt;Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper 6.0&lt;/em&gt;. Download Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper 6.0 Software, V73995-01.zip and copy it into the VM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a Terminal and execute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;sudo mkdir /opt/ocsg6
sudo chown oracle:oracle /opt/ocsg6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unzip the file and execute the installer:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;unzip V73995-01.zip
java -jar ocsg_generic.jar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the first window, accept the default Inventory Directory pressing &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/Inventory.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inventory Screen&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Welcome screen appears, press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/Welcome.png&quot; alt=&quot;Welcome Screen&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduce &lt;em&gt;/opt/ocsg6&lt;/em&gt; in the Oracle Home field and press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select &lt;em&gt;Custom Installation&lt;/em&gt; and press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;. Check all the features and press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/AllFeatures.png&quot; alt=&quot;Custom Installation&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Prerequisite Check should be OK. Press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the IP in the first field. Introduce the password for the domain user and for the Partner and API Management Portal user. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;welcome1&lt;/em&gt; in my case but you can use something different. Let the default value in others fields and press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/Credentials.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credentials&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce the IP in /etc/hosts with &lt;strong&gt;ocsg&lt;/strong&gt; as reference. If you ping &lt;strong&gt;ocsg&lt;/strong&gt;, you should receive a response from the IP you&amp;rsquo;ve noted in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;em&gt;Java DB&lt;/em&gt; selected and press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/Javadb.png&quot; alt=&quot;JavaDB&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review the Installation Summary and press &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;. It may take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Services-Gatekeeper-6-installed-in-fifteen-minutes-is-it-possible/IntallationEnd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Installation End&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; when available and &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I am very glad to be part of TADHack again. The last year it was a great experience but everything was new so, with my previous experience, and I am sure this year I am going to enjoy it even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we continue &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.tadhack.com/2015/04/13/oracle-developer-resources/&quot;&gt;collaborating with Oracle Comms&lt;/a&gt; providing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/&quot;&gt;Oracle Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s challenging and fun at the same time. Someone may think this year is easier because it&amp;rsquo;s the second time&amp;hellip; No!. There are a lot of new things and, even most important, we&amp;rsquo;ve deployed the last versions of all the Oracle Comms products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications Converged Application Server 7.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper 6.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller 7.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am specially excited with OCCAS, there are a lot of new features and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to learn more and do something with it. It would be great to develop some hack and participate also as developer in the Hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer or you work with Oracle Comms and you want to check the last versions, don&amp;rsquo;t miss the opportunity. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com&quot;&gt;tadhack.optaresolutions.com&lt;/a&gt; or check the following webinar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://alanquayle.com/&quot;&gt;Alan Quayle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait&quot;&gt;Doug Tait&lt;/a&gt; and myself introducing the Oracle sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDjzDVQucoM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you can find my slides, I am trying a more visual style so I recommend the webinar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/HMWqhusiViKKdK&quot; width=&quot;476&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope see you in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.com/2015/&quot;&gt;TADHack Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oracle's demos in the MWC2015 review</title>

      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;This March has been crazy. Starting with the Mobile World Congress and next week flying to Brazil for three weeks because of an Oracle Comms project&amp;hellip; Impossible to find time to tweet, blog or whatever, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pity because there a lot of news!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start from the beginning: the Mobile World Congress. I always like to assist to this event. Everybody is there, so it&amp;rsquo;s very tired but also very productive. I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in more than 20 meetings, some conferences, the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/WebRTC-Barcelona/&quot;&gt;WebRTC Meetup&lt;/a&gt; organized by our friends Quobis (don&amp;rsquo;t miss the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-81k_pDU24&quot;&gt;Stefano Gioia presentation&lt;/a&gt;) and, this year for first time, I was able to find some time slot to see demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived to the Oracle booth, I quickly noticed the key topic of this year: Network Function Virtualization (NFV). So, it&amp;rsquo;s not strange most of the demos were related to this in some way. I&amp;rsquo;ve started with a demo using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/diameter-signaling-router/index.html&quot;&gt;Diameter Signaling Router&lt;/a&gt;, a Tekelec product. The demo was mainly showing how they are able to add new nodes to increase the processing capacity dynamically. They defined it as NFV compliant and well.. I was a bit disappointed with this. For me, NFV is not to be able to add new nodes to a cluster system.. it&amp;rsquo;s the capacity to increase the resources dynamically&amp;hellip;. and always in the same way, a centralized way. And this should be the point. NFV shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be virtualization, clustering or geographic-redundancy&amp;hellip; they were invented some time ago. The other thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t like: the solutions wasn&amp;rsquo;t based in Coherence or even Weblogic&amp;hellip; which it should be pointless when you are in an Oracle booth. Anyway, the product looks very interesting, robust and well-designed.. and the people in the booth were really professional and skilled with diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I jumped to the next demo and I was very pleased to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Services Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; integrated with the Oracle Tekelec PCRF&amp;hellip; very interesting use case. I&amp;rsquo;ve to try it but I don&amp;rsquo;t know the Tekelec PCRF and it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to find documentation about it (I mean, a simple how-to). There are good documentation in the OCSG side, &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e55395/ipl_pcrf.htm#SGIPL700&quot;&gt;Integrating Services Gatekeeper with a PCRF&lt;/a&gt;, but it lacks the PCRF steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued with a huge demo involving &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Services Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/unified-communications/converged-application-server-edition/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Converged Application Server&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/siebel/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Siebel&lt;/a&gt;. The use case is very well designed: the subscriber can browse the Siebel front-end where he has a lot of information available and now, he has also an interface to watch movies (or whatever) in streaming.. something like Netflix but linked to the CSP account. The subscriber choose a movie to watch and he can choose between pay the total amount (using his billing account in the CSP) or save some money watching some advertisement sponsored by Service Providers/Third parties (very clever use of the OCSG PRM interface!). The demo is very visual and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SteveNorthridge&quot;&gt;@SteveNorthridge&lt;/a&gt; explanations very clear to understand the use case and possibilities. I am sure we&amp;rsquo;ll speak a lot about this demo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next demo it&amp;rsquo;s well know: the WebRTC Real state demo. I was in the event where it was showed the first time and I am never tired of it. Here it&amp;rsquo;s the video, I am sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait&quot;&gt;@Doug_Tait&lt;/a&gt; explains it better than me :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2CZxyR3ftw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a demo showing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/unified-communications/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications Unified Communications Suite&lt;/a&gt; enhanced with WebRTC capabilities. It makes sense combine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;WebRTC Session Controller&lt;/a&gt; with different Oracle products, and UCS is the logical first step. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikis.oracle.com/display/CommSuite/Overview+of+Convergence+with+WebRTC&quot;&gt;Oracle wiki&lt;/a&gt; there a lot of good information about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spend some time in the Analytics demo. It&amp;rsquo;s not my area but the use case are pretty interesting, specially related to churn detection and some of the systems I work with are a good source of information. Furthermore the company where I work, Optare Solutions, is doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://optaresolutions.com/innovacion/&quot;&gt;some interesting things&lt;/a&gt; related to this and the guy in the stand was really kind and skilled in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that I jumped to the most interesting demo for me: the whole NFV solution. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have luck this time because the main analyst (someone I had previous meeting with) was busy all the time and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity to have all my questions answered. Anyway, I found out some interesting points:&lt;br/&gt;* The solutions look good, very complete and mature, using a mix of Oracle technologies including virtualization, Oracle OSS (an old friend of mine, UIM) and Oracle ACME products. Oracle has a huge portfolio so it makes sense to use them instead of reinvent the wheel.&lt;br/&gt;* It&amp;rsquo;s very flexible and powerful but it has a cost: it&amp;rsquo;s complex because it involves some big products. Very good for carriers but no so good for small companies.&lt;br/&gt;* Openstack as cloud computing platform software but it&amp;rsquo;s not mandatory, you can choose Oracle VM Server, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for me the most important point, Oracle is starting to include Network functions. And it&amp;rsquo;s easy, because the Oracle technologies are based in Java / Weblogic and they have some interesting Network applications, as for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/unified-communications/converged-application-server-edition/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications Converged Application Server (OCCAS)&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/application-session-controller/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications Application Session Controller&lt;/a&gt;. I expect very interesting news in the next months related to this and it&amp;rsquo;s going to be big, because this is something only Oracle can provide so easily, so a good competitive advantage over their competitors in the NFV area. Also don&amp;rsquo;t miss [the demo with Intel](Oracle Communications Advances Network Function Virtualization by Delivering Carrier-Grade Data Center Performance) announced some days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended the tour with a visit to Connected Vehicle demo. It&amp;rsquo;s not related to any Oracle Comms product but I worked in a similar project some months ago and Oracle solutions are always interesting. The demo isn&amp;rsquo;t very impressive but it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how they are using Java to build it. I thought a lot on it and how to use it for other use cases. Here it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/internetofthings/java-iot-connected-vehicle-wp-2401533.pdf&quot;&gt;the whitepaper with all the information about the Connected Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, MWC2015 was a great event and I am not going anymore to miss the opportunity to review a demo .&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talendforge.org/tutorials/tutorial.php?idTuto=14&quot;&gt;Talend Open Studio&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. It&amp;rsquo;s an impressive software to do automated tasks, it works well and the development is quite fast. Furthermore, the TtHW (Time to Hello World) is really short. As you can see, I like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I am going to show how to use it Talend Open Studio to access the JMS Topic where OCSG shows all the runtime information: the Event Data Records (EDRs). This is the main place for debugging so it&amp;rsquo;s really important. The article is based in the offical documentation &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e50771/pds_edrlistener.htm#SGPDS627&quot;&gt;Creating EDR Listeners&lt;/a&gt; but adapted to TOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pre-requisites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need an OCSG 6 or 5.1 running and also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talend.com/download/talend-open-studio?qt-product_tos_download=3#qt-product_tos_download&quot;&gt;TOS Data Integration&lt;/a&gt; installed in your computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Talend Open Studio development&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop a tJMSInput component in the canvas and double click over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Access-OCSG-EDR-JMS-Topic-with-Talend-Open-Studio/tJMSInput.png&quot; alt=&quot;tJMSInput component&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configure all the fields as you can see in the following picture:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Access-OCSG-EDR-JMS-Topic-with-Talend-Open-Studio/tJMSInput_form.png&quot; alt=&quot;tJMSInput fields&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some important notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to import the library &lt;em&gt;wlthint3client.jar&lt;/em&gt; before to use the component. You can find it in &lt;em&gt;&lt;OCSG Installation folder&gt;/wlserver/server/lib/wlthint3client.jar&lt;/em&gt;. To import it, there are several ways, for instance, the tLibraryLoad component.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the &lt;strong&gt;Server URL&lt;/strong&gt; to your environment configuration. It must be a Node, not an Admin. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s an standalone configuration with Admin and Node in the same Weblogic instance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the &lt;strong&gt;Message from&lt;/strong&gt; to your environment configuration. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it, go to the Console,in the Domain Structure, &lt;strong&gt;Services -&amp;gt; Messaging -&amp;gt; JMS Servers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weblogic configuration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a missing point, and it&amp;rsquo;s the key. In the Weblogic console: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the Domain Structure and Select &lt;strong&gt;Services -&amp;gt; Messaging -&amp;gt; JMS-Modules&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;WLNGJMSResource -&amp;gt; EdrTopic -&amp;gt; Advanced&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find &lt;strong&gt;Create Destination Identifier&lt;/strong&gt; and introduce &lt;em&gt;com.bea.wlcp.wlng.edr.EdrTopic&lt;/em&gt; and Save.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reboot the Weblogic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Access-OCSG-EDR-JMS-Topic-with-Talend-Open-Studio/WeblogicJMSConfiguration.png&quot; alt=&quot;Weblogic JMS Configuration&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step is mandatory because of the tJMSInput component but it can be avoided if you are accessing the JMS Topic in another way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The end&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all. Click on Run in the Talend Open Studio and you should be subscribed to the Topic. Send an SMS from the PTE and you should start to generate EDRs. The next step would be create the Java classes to access the EDR information and start to work with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;This is going to be a different type of post. I usually write about technical things but today I am going to try something different. Well, maybe not so different, I have more questions than answers, but at least, I will try to explain as I see the Oracle Comms portfolio and its evolution. Just for the record, I don&amp;rsquo;t work inside Oracle, I don&amp;rsquo;t have privileged information and if you do any business decision based in this article, you are a fool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/metasolv/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle acquired MetaSolv&lt;/a&gt;, recognized leader in service fulfillment operations support system (OSS) solutions for next-generation communications service providers. Two years later, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/bea/index.html&quot;&gt;Bea Systems&amp;hellip; and with it, Weblogic Server&lt;/a&gt;, the Application Server leader of the market. After that, Oracle has build a strong position in the OSS market, no only from a business perspective, also from a technical point of view. All the products are similar (from the CRM to the Inventory) and they share the same architectural principles. As consequence, CSPs enjoy some advantages. For example, after the first deployment, they have the knowledge and experience to continue deploying the rest of the suite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1903221&quot;&gt;Oracle bought Acme Packet&lt;/a&gt;, the leading global provider of session border control technology. One month later &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/tekelec/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle bought Tekelec&lt;/a&gt;, a leading provider of network signaling, policy control, and subscriber data management solutions for communications networks. All the analysts saw this as a big movement to the Network market. Me too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Comms Converged Application Server&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of people didn&amp;rsquo;t realize Oracle had a previous portfolio of Networks Applications before the acquisition. Even if this suite is no so big as the OSS and BSS suites, it has importance and business share inside the firm&amp;hellip; and something more important, a very intelligent roadmap based in OCCAS as network platform for everything. But&amp;hellip;. what is OCCAS? The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/unified-communications/converged-application-server-edition/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications Converged Application Server&lt;/a&gt; is a Weblogic with Telecom Network capabilities (mainly SIP and Diameter) and oriented to real-time applications. As product, it&amp;rsquo;s very small. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to find a CSP asking for it, because the business case is not so clear. OCCAS is more like a Framework, something you are going to use to develop other things. And, in fact, most of the SDP portfolio is based in OCCAS, for instance, OCSG and the Unified Communications suite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Converged Application Server &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E27702_01/doc.51/e27705/tpd_developing.htm#autoId1&quot;&gt;Service Creation Environment&lt;/a&gt; (SCE) consists of a faceted framework that supplements the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; (OEPE). The SCE provides tools and resources you can use to develop converged applications, including wizards, simulators, and templates. And also it provides the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E27702_01/doc.51/e27707/sip_sft_overview.htm&quot;&gt;Service Foundation Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; (SFT), a converged application Java development framework. It provides APIs that abstract the details of the communication protocol for the application, enabling to focus on the service value provided by converged SIP and HTTP applications. The idea is simple: if you are a developer with Java and Eclipse knowledge, you can start to develop Telecom applications without knowledge about Telecom protocols. And those applications will run in the leader platform: Weblogic. So they will be carrier-grade with all the performance, security and scalability requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E27702_01/doc.51/e27705/img/sce_overview.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Converged Application Server Service Creation Environment&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Comms Roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A roadmap with all the Network products based in OCCAS makes sense for several reasons. Some of them are:&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Contrasted technologies&lt;/strong&gt;: Java, Weblogic, the Oracle Database, Linux, Eclipse and so on. You are not reinventing the wheel. All those technologies are familiar to the CSPs, they trust them.&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Cloud and virtualization&lt;/strong&gt;: CSPs want to be ready for the near future. They know about the advantages of virtualization and cloud strategies. And OCCAS is the perfect choice for that. You can run it in several platforms, deploy it, scale it and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s flexible and modern.&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Learn one, use many&lt;/strong&gt;: you start deploying one application, and after that, you will have the knowledge and resources to deploy the rest of the suite (if you want). You will save a lot of time learning complex systems or technologies so you will be more flexible and faster delivering new products to the market.&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Easy support&lt;/strong&gt;: the Operation team needs to know about basic technologies: no more, no less. As you need a DBA, you will need a Weblogic expert who can work with all the systems. In short, the daily support will be easier because the level of complexity is smaller.&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Maintenance and upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;: all the products are going to do it in the same way and it&amp;rsquo;s out-of-the-box in Weblogic. Converged Applications Server&amp;rsquo;s upgrade feature ensures that no calls are dropped while during the upgrade of a production application. The upgrade process also enables you to revert or rollback the process of upgrading an application. If, for example, you determine that there is a problem with the newer version of the deployed application, you can undeploy the newer version and activate the older version.&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;High availability and geographic redundancy&lt;/strong&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s provided out-of-the-box, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need worry about that.&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;The BSS/OSS suite&lt;/strong&gt;: it&amp;rsquo;s based on the same technologies. Any CSP with some of those products installed has the experience and knowledge to start to work with OCCAS or any OCCAS-based product and the integration between BSS/OSS and Network would be easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we saw before in the OSS suite, this is a winner strategy. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t end here. After have everything running in the same platform, Oracle can start to work in the integration between the products, something like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/application-integration-architecture/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Application Integration Architecture (AIA)&lt;/a&gt; but oriented to the network. Any network vendor in the market can compete with something like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final question: is Oracle going to migrate the ACME and Tekelec products to the OCCAS platform?. We know the advantages but there are also problems. Migrate part of the portfolio to this platform requires a lot of resources and it&amp;rsquo;s very time-consuming. And of course, not all the products are valid (specific hardware systems doesn&amp;rsquo;t have sense in OCCAS) or they are not going to have enough Return of Investment. So, I don&amp;rsquo;t have an answer for that. After two years, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see movements in this direction but I also know the acquisitions take a lot of time and it&amp;rsquo;s soon yet. Oracle did a great job combining OCCAS and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50379_01/index.htm&quot;&gt;Application Session Controller&lt;/a&gt; (ASC) to launch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;WebRTC Session Controller&lt;/a&gt; (WSC). That is for sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/COMMSINFODEV/entry/new_tech_new_challenges_the&quot;&gt;the path to follow&lt;/a&gt; but they are just two products running independently and integrated using a REST interface and we are speaking about have the ASC capabilities running on OCCAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Oracle has announced recently the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/2418407&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications Network Service Orchestration Solution&lt;/a&gt;. This is the mainly Oracle NFV bet but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look based in OCCAS or even Weblogic. And we know, Oracle can buy some specific NFV/SDN company, they don&amp;rsquo;t need to develop their own solution&amp;hellip; but with more acquisitions the path to have only one platform will be even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year we probably will see a new version release of OCCAS. That will be the moment to know about the future of this excellent platform. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;The new OCSG version is available and there are a lot of new interesting things, starting with a Documentation reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/OCSG-doc-v6.png&quot; alt=&quot;OCSG v6 documentation&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the press note (source &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-894950?sr=stream#comment-897214&quot;&gt;Oracle Community&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle Communications is pleased to announce that as of Thursday, 22 January 2015, we ntroduced the most comprehensive API exposure platform in the industry with the release of Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper 6.0 (OCSG 6.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OCSG 6.0 introduces expansive API Management capabilities to manage the entire API lifecycle enabling enterprises and CSPs to accelerate internal development, engage with partners and monetize assets. OCSG 6.0 delivers this alongside industry leading SLA management, analytics and an extensive array of built-in communications services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the OCSG 6.0 release, a new OCSG-based solution, called “Network Policy as a Service” (NPaaS), was launched by integrating the Oracle Communications Policy Management (OCPM) PCRF to provide out-of-the-box exposure of network policy for both telephony and cable networks. This allows CSPs and partners to align the data bandwidth with the digital service being delivered, ensuring a higher rate of customer satisfaction.&lt;br/&gt;OCSG 6.0’s API Management, simplified configuration and lightweight deployment features enable new API exposure use cases for enterprise IT integration, including:&lt;br/&gt;* Contact center application enablement&lt;br/&gt;* API exposure for Communications Enabled Business Processes (CEBP) and Unified Communications (UC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** KEY FEATURES OF THE OCSG 6.0 RELEASE **&lt;br/&gt;* API Management made powerful and simple&lt;br/&gt; * Web Service API generation in the Portal allows APIs to be built in minutes&lt;br/&gt; * API catalog and versioning&lt;br/&gt; * Onboard and manage partners&lt;br/&gt; * API Monitoring, analytics, metering and charging&lt;br/&gt; * Management and partner portals&lt;br/&gt;* Simplified configuration and deployment with installation in 15 minutes&lt;br/&gt;* Lightweight single tier deployment option&lt;br/&gt;* Integration with the Oracle Communications Policy Management (OCPM) PCRF to safely and securely expose network policy through the Parlay X and Restful QoS APIs&lt;br/&gt;* Enhanced Oauth integration simplifies integration with SSO and IDM&lt;br/&gt;* Enterprise Manager Cloud Control integration facilitates cloud-based deployments&lt;br/&gt;* Advanced API firewall provides protection against a multitude of security threats&lt;br/&gt;* Integration with OCCAS Service Controller provides a broad array of SS7 interface options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product releases are available for download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://edelivery.oracle.com/&quot;&gt;Oracle Software Delivery Cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More documentation can be found via Services &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/index.htm&quot;&gt;Gatekeeper 6.0 Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s soon yet to write a detailed analysis but I would like to highlight some takeaways. This is not the typical release.. in fact, there isn&amp;rsquo;t an official announcement as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen previously. There are a lot of small improvements to help operators and system integrators to work with OCSG which it&amp;rsquo;s great. Some of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;** &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e54151/toc.htm&quot;&gt;New Default Single-system Installation Option and Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt;:** everything in a single package (database included), it&amp;rsquo;s going to save us a lot of time and PoCs will be easier. Great point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;** &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/index.htm&quot;&gt;Documentation Improvements&lt;/a&gt;:** I&amp;rsquo;ve to check them yet but the new structure looks better and, for sure, some sections in the 5.1 documentation could be improved/corrected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;** &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e55395/ipl_pcrf.htm#SGIPL700&quot;&gt;PCRF Integration Example&lt;/a&gt;:** This is something I really appreciate because I was working on that and it&amp;rsquo;s really hard because of the lack of information and references to the Tekelec product. I will do it very soon but after a first look, it lacks a bit more of detail in the Tekelec PCRF setup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;** &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e50764/prm_intro.htm#SGPRM106&quot;&gt;Extending the Portal User Interfaces and Portal Developer&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/a&gt;: ** I know there are a lot of improvements in this part. An easier installation and customization, for sure, one of the points everybody asked with the previous version.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;** &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e54898/toc.htm&quot;&gt;New API Management Features&lt;/a&gt;: ** OCSG competes some times (but not always) with more general products as API gateways. Improvements in this part are warmly welcomed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I miss some things as more Geographic redundancy improvements and more debugging options but it&amp;rsquo;s soon yet to know if they&amp;rsquo;re or not in this release. Anyway, there are more interesting improvements, consult the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E50778_01/doc.60/e50775/toc.htm&quot;&gt;Release Note&lt;/a&gt; for detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will try to write some specific articles showing the new features. Just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.serviceandnetworkevolution.com/&quot;&gt;subscribe to the blog&lt;/a&gt; to keep yourself informed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Deal with java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space errors is always tricky. Most of the times it&amp;rsquo;s something related to the chosen JVM, probably not supported for the hosting OS (for example, using a 32bits JVM in a 64bits OS is a typical issue).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here I provide two interesting ways to check the JVM configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/antonmry/efe307a587388c3ecdfb.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, perhaps we could want to increase the PermSize, so we edit the &amp;lt;Domain dir &amp;gt;/ &amp;lt;Server Name &amp;gt;/bin/setDomainEnv.sh to add something like this in the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# USER_MEM_ARGS   - The variable to override the standard memory arguments
#                   passed to java.

USER_MEM_ARGS=&amp;quot;-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:CompileThreshold=8000 -XX:PermSize=256m&amp;quot;
export USER_MEM_ARGS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to reboot the weblogic and check everything again using the same commands I showed previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More info:&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs100/config_scripting/using_WLST.html#wp1093952&quot;&gt;Invoking WLST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs100/config_scripting/monitoring.html&quot;&gt;Getting Runtime Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/practicalbpm/entry/wlst_scripting_to_get_weblogic&quot;&gt;WLST Scripting Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
      &lt;p&gt;I was invited recently to participate in the Pre-conference Oracle WebRTC Workshop of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadsummit.com/2014/&quot;&gt;TADSummit 2014&lt;/a&gt; (Istanbul). I should speak about the implementation and architecture details of a WebRTC deployment in a Communication Service Provider. It was a real challenge, I had a lot of work in the previous weeks and I know about the excellent quality of the other speakers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait&quot;&gt;Doug&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EPCarrera&quot;&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt; from Quobis or Stephano Gioia (who made a highly recommended presentation about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/gioste/webrtc-workshop-what-i&quot;&gt;What is (and isn&amp;rsquo;t WebRTC)&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without time and being a technical guy, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do something different, speaking about our experience in the TADHack 2014 (where we&amp;rsquo;ve deployed and supported the Oracle platform) and a combination of some previous experiences from the deployment in some LATAM operators. Here you can see the slides:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41656265&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&quot; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom:5px&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;//www.slideshare.net/antonry/webrtc-preconference-oracle-workshop-v3&quot; title=&quot;Oracle - WebRTC Pre-conference TADSummit Workshop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oracle - WebRTC Pre-conference TADSummit Workshop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//www.slideshare.net/antonry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;antonry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And also a photo from Optare (Thanks!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDPs team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TADSummit&quot;&gt;@TADSummit&lt;/a&gt; present our experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OracleComms&quot;&gt;@OracleComms&lt;/a&gt; SDPs.Ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antonmry&quot;&gt;@antonmry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NachoGarmilla&quot;&gt;@NachoGarmilla&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ulsni&quot;&gt;@ulsni&lt;/a&gt; for info &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/IO7ASFxJgb&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IO7ASFxJgb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Optare Solutions (@optaresolutions) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/optaresolutions/status/532143459977920512&quot;&gt;November 11, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the Pre-conference workshop. It was very constructive and some of the assistants were very interested in WebRTC and the business model behind it. In general, TADSummit was an excellent event, three days full of meetings and very interesting conversations about WebRTC and Telecom APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something I&amp;rsquo;ve particularly enjoyed this time: Istanbul. Amazing city.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Some weeks ago, Oracle has proposed us to write an article about WebRTC to be published in its blog: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.webrtc-solutions.com&quot;&gt;http://blog.webrtc-solutions.com&lt;/a&gt;. I was in charge of the main edition, with some colleges helping in the revision (thanks Sandra, Eva and Nacho!). It was a good time to review why WebRTC is so important to us. There are a lot of companies involved today with WebRTC, different sectors, different sizes and types as you can see in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cio2cmo.com/webrtc-landscape-infographic-june-2014/&quot;&gt;The WebRTC Landscape Infographic&lt;/a&gt; from Brad Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cio2cmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WebRTC-Landscape-Infographic-2014-06.png&quot; alt=&quot;The WebRTC Landscape Infographic – June 2014&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebRTC is so exciting for us because very specific reasons&amp;hellip; so I&amp;rsquo;ve developed our motivations in the article: as expert in telecom service exposure, WebRTC is the perfect choice to expose one of the main telecom assets: voice, and with less importance yet, video. In fact, I see WebRTC as a key part of the Service Delivery Platforms of the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.webrtc-solutions.com/webrtc-as-key-part-of-service-exposure/&quot;&gt;WebRTC as key part of Service Exposure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As part of the activities we did for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.com/2014/&quot;&gt;TADHack 2014&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvVYH-tpEw8&quot;&gt;this short tutorial&lt;/a&gt; about the Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper SDK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvVYH-tpEw8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting tool for developers, a lot of people asked us for it and Oracle allow us to distribute it between the TADHack participants&amp;hellip; It can made a big different for a CSP trying to engage developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information is available in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36135_01/doc.51/e37529/toc.htm&quot;&gt;Oracle® Communications Services Gatekeeper SDK User&amp;rsquo;s Guide Release 5.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In May 2014, Oracle propose us to deploy and manage its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/service-network-evolution/index.html&quot;&gt;SANE solution&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.com/2014/&quot;&gt;TADHack event&lt;/a&gt; and support the developers community. With only a few weeks, it was a big challenge. I&amp;rsquo;ve participated as technical responsible and it was a great experience because it was a very different type of project: any operator was involved so we were free to choose the platform. Also the requirements were very different: the main goal was engage the developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the list of activities we did:&lt;br/&gt;1. Create &lt;a href=&quot;http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/&quot;&gt;a website&lt;/a&gt; with all the information needed by the developers.&lt;br/&gt;2. Create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OTADHack&quot;&gt;Github community&lt;/a&gt; to provide source code samples, a ticketing system and so on.&lt;br/&gt;3. We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/connected-digital-lifestyle/services-gatekeeper/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/web-rtc-session-controller/overview/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle Communications WebRTC Session Controller&lt;/a&gt; in Amazon Web Services to give access to the developers.&lt;br/&gt;* We run some webinars, as for example this one with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alanquayle.com/&quot;&gt;Alan Quayle&lt;/a&gt;, Oracle Comms and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alerant.com/&quot;&gt;Alerant&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/0NXr68zvGrA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a great experience and I hope to repeat the next year!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optare Solutions consultant &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antonmry&quot;&gt;@antonmry&lt;/a&gt; explains how to setup &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OracleComms&quot;&gt;@OracleComms&lt;/a&gt; environments for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TelcoAPI?src=hash&quot;&gt;#TelcoAPI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/webrtc?src=hash&quot;&gt;#webrtc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/rDtmlxitxB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rDtmlxitxB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Optare Solutions (@optaresolutions) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/optaresolutions/status/474938349778903040&quot;&gt;June 6, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
