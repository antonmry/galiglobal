I've published my first article in the New Relic blog! [Monitoring Apache Kafka
for cloud cost reduction] is a summary of some of the initiatives I've been
working on since I joined New Relic 2.5 years ago.

It has been a very interesting journey and I've learnt a lot in the process. In
particular about Cloud providers and how to tune Kafka servers and huge
workloads for them.

Enjoy the article and let me know your thoughts on [Twitter].
