        <p><em>08 May 2019</em></p>
        <p>As a Software Engineer and usual participant in different Tech communities, it
        was always a priority for me to involve in the Tech community the company where
        I work. I really believe it's a win-win for the company and for the community
        but I also know it's quite complex.</p>
        <p>Have you ever do it something for the first time? If someone appears from
        nowhere and says you suck on that, probably you will lose the interest very
        soon. Even if that person approached with good intentions or saying the truth,
        the timing is crucial here. This happens all the time to opening companies. They
        stop the process and it's a pity.</p>
        <p>As co-organizer of local JUGs and conferences, I was asked several times from
        different companies about this. It's hard to answer, there are so many things
        involved. So I prepared a list of possible answers to help you in the path to
        collaborate with the community.</p>
        <h2 id="have-clear-your-reasons">Have clear your reasons</h2>
        <p>There a lot of reasons for a company to start collaborating with the Tech
        community. Just choose whatever makes sense for your company. But they must be
        valuable. In this case, pro-bono work is fine for individuals but not for
        companies. There is nothing wrong in analysing it as an investment.</p>
        <p>There are mainly three reasons for most of the companies:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Recruiting. If you want to hire the best engineers you can find, go to the
           Tech community. They aren't the best only for their technical skills but also
           for their soft skills: they know how to speak in public, make a successful
           network of collaborators, organize events, etc. All those things are quite
           practical in any company.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Help to grow your own engineers. Have your own people attending meetups,
           conferences, katas, etc. will help them to have different ideas, see what's
           working in the industry, etc. If they participate actively (as speakers or
           organizers), they also will grow as professionals and they will be busy and
           motivated so it will help with retention.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>To find new business opportunities. I lose the count of how many of those I
           found since I started to collaborate. This is a real thing. Just let your
           engineers speak with others and they will find solutions to their problems.
           That's what engineers do.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You may have others. It doesn't matter. Just make sure they are clear for your
        company and you act accordingly to them.</p>
        <h2 id="how-do-we-start">How do we start?</h2>
        <p>Baby steps. Never start with a big program or a big budget. It's very important
        to be cautious in the beginning. Most of the people don't know your company or
        they have an idea quite negative about it. That's normal. You never have
        collaborated with the community before and probably have rejected candidates,
        fired employees, etc. and nobody is sharing the good things. It's time to change
        it but it will require time. Be patient.</p>
        <p>My advice here it's to find a non-profit local community and ask the organizers.
        You will be surprised by how helpful they will be without any type of hiding
        interest or retribution.</p>
        <p>It should be local, it's better to start locally and grow from there instead of
        jump directly into national or international events. It doesn't matter your
        size. People are connected. When you go to an international conference, the
        organizers will have local contacts and they will ask so it's better if you make
        your homework first. Everything will be easier.</p>
        <p>Also, choose your first community carefully. It should be related to the
        technologies you are using and also non-profit. Most of the Tech communities are
        great and there aren't hidden interests but it isn't always the case, especially
        if they aren't related only to Technology (entrepreneurship, blockchain, etc.).
        They aren't bad but they aren't a good start because someone may take advantage
        and have her own interests. If they aren't helpful or just ask for money, jump
        to the next one.</p>
        <p>You will have time in the future to come back a start a deeper collaboration
        once you know who is who in the community (and no, sadly Twitter and popularity
        doesn't help on that).</p>
        <h2 id="should-we-organize-our-own-groupevent">Should we organize our own group/event?</h2>
        <p>Some companies like to start with their own group or conference. It usually
        doesn't work well in the short-term. My advice is to start contributing before
        to create something from scratch. Again, it isn't about your size or expertise,
        it takes time to do things well so start small and grow from there. Think about
        what's better for your interests. The ego never helps.</p>
        <p>It's a lot better if you name some of your engineers as ambassadors in the Tech
        community. It's a partial-time role. His mission is to establish the link
        between both words: help the communities from the company and promote the
        community inside. Make sure they can decide and you are listening when they give
        their opinion. If a possible sponsorship is evaluated only by HR, you are
        missing important information.</p>
        <h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h2>
        <p>Once you have a connection with the organizers they will start to propose
        different types of collaboration. If they are good organizers, not only for
        their own community, for others too. Don't be surprised if the Java guys ask for
        sponsorship in a PHP conference ;-)</p>
        <p>The easiest thing is event sponsorship but most of the companies are doing it
        wrong. It isn't about giving money for a list of services (a talk slot, publish
        your logo, etc.). Those things are ok but they aren't enough.</p>
        <p>If your company is going to be a sponsor of a conference, there are things you
        should do:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Make sure some engineers of your company attend the conference and organizers
          know about them so they can introduce everybody to them. It's sad when a
          company pay money and there is nobody to ask at the conference. There is no
          better ambassador than your own employees and social networking is the most
          important thing in a conference.</li>
        <li>Ask the organizers if your company can help in some way: find speakers or
          other sponsors, promote the conference or record the talks. Once you start to
          collaborate in this way, organizers will start to contribute back and speak
          nicely about your company to others. That's the type of publicity you want.</li>
        <li>Promote the event and talks in your social media. It's free, easy to do and
          with a great impact on your Company image.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of the best things in a conference it's sending some of your engineers to
        make a talk and share their experiences. Everybody loves that, people will
        provide great real feedback and will get interested. It's a win-win and quite
        easy.</p>
        <h2 id="social-media-and-blogs">Social media and blogs</h2>
        <p>If you don't show something to the world, it doesn't exist. Social media is
        important. Most of the HR departments are quite familiar with Linkedin, but most
        of the engineers receive their news from Twitter. So start to promote your
        projects, events, communities, etc. and show a more human view of your company.
        But be careful: in case of doubt, don't publish it. Nobody wants to deal with
        trolls.</p>
        <p>If you don't want to pollute your Social Media mixing messages for engineers and
        customers, create a new account specifically for that. It would help a lot but
        make sure you keep it alive!.</p>
        <p>There are companies also launching an Engineering blog. It's a great idea which
        helps to promote your brand, but also to create some type of shared identity in
        your company and gives deserved credit to your engineers. The only problem: it
        takes time. If you do it, plan it carefully for the long-term.</p>
        <h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
        <p>Open source is another good way to collaborate with the community. Just open a
        GitHub organization and let your engineers know they can publish software there.
        It would need some reviewing and validation process but it's a great way,
        especially if they start to work in the open, not just publish the final
        outcome.</p>
        <p>Another way is contribute to open source projects. Part of the dedication of
        some of your engineers can go to fix bugs, create new features, documentation,
        etc.</p>
        <p>Not only will help to collaborate with the community, but it would also have a
        positive impact on the company improving quality, performance and talent
        retention. That deserves another blog post.</p>
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of ways and reasons to collaborate with the community. Ask other
        companies: worth it. But it isn't as easy as you may think. So start small and
        ask people with experience and good intentions. They will help. And remember,
        your engineers are the best ambassadors you may have in the Tech community.
        Empower them!.</p>
