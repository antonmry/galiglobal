        <p><em>20 March 2019</em></p>
        <p>Ok, I'm writing my goals for 2019 in the end of March. What's wrong with me?.
        Well, somehow it makes sense in my head. For several reasons I wasn't sure about
        my goals this year, the situation wasn't stable enough to do that reasoning but
        let's start with the beginning.</p>
        <p>I don't usually review the previous year goals but I have to. 2018 has been one
        of the most complicated years of my life. I have to write a post about being
        father explaining how difficult is children concurrency and how important is to
        do your homework before. In my case, two relocations, rebuild an old house and
        move to remote work again. Right now, I define my wife and myself as survivors
        :-)</p>
        <p>In that context, I started the year exhausted, worried and focused in recovering
        which involved a lot of things and some changes. My only goal was recover my
        life. Luckily I'm a lot better now.</p>
        <p>In the professional area, I'm not sure yet what's my goal for 2019. Now I'm
        quite focused in my role as Technical Director in Optare. It's a great role
        which allows me to help others and do many different things: management but also
        some development and system administration. It has a positive impact in the
        company and it suits quite well with my actual life.</p>
        <p>But there are challenges too. I never expect to stay in that role more than one
        year so sometimes I act as it was something temporary. I shouldn't. Also I miss
        a lot spend more time coding <strong>without interruptions</strong> and the thousand of
        context changes I usually have. Being a remote worker doesn't help. Finally, I
        have been working for the same company more than 10 years. Even if I don't think
        there is any better place to work and I had multiple roles in multiple clients,
        it feels weird sometimes and somehow I have to deal with that.</p>
        <p>So my professional goal for 2019 is to continue positive and be more and more
        productive.</p>
        <p>Regarding the tech community. I co-founded the VigoJUG in 2017 with important
        contributions to VigoTech in the same year. 2018 was for CoruñaJUG and our first
        Java conference: XantarJ.</p>
        <p>For 2019 I had the idea of promote CoruñaTech but it has been a failure until
        now. In this point I don't think A Coruña is ready for a community like that. We
        need more local tech groups and more people involved. There is no a clear
        organizer or leader of VigoTech, it's a really distributed community effort. I
        really think it's the only way.</p>
        <p>So my "community" goal will be the CoruñaJUG and the VigoJUG again. But I really
        like the JUGs how they are. I don't care about how many members or how many
        people came to the events. I only care about if there are good places to share
        knowledge and have fun and I think they are. So what to do?. Probably the only
        answer I have is to find more speakers (local and international) which means
        more fun and more knowledge.</p>
        <p>Regarding conferences, last year I attended JCrete. I didn't have the
        opportunity to profit the conference as much as I would like because some sad
        events. But I love the format and the original idea. I really would like to
        build something similar here but not so Java related, more community focused.</p>
        <p>I also attended as speaker JBCNConf which motivated me to co-launch the first
        XantarJ. It was a great initiative, we have to repeat it this year!</p>
        <p>In 2019, I will continue attending conferences when possible but I'm going to
        focus in non-profit events where they don't charge the attendants and travel
        expenses are covered. It seems fair to me.</p>
        <p>Regarding my personal life, I stopped drinking any coffee or alcohol last year
        but I wasn't able to back to sport. It's a pending point.</p>
        <p>My family and kids will continue being the most important thing.</p>
