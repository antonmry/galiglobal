		<h1>Thanks, Optare!</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>10 May 2019</em></p>

	<p><p>Today it&rsquo;s a very sad day for me: it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to all my colleagues in Optare. I internally announced it four weeks ago so I should have enough time to process it, but I didn&rsquo;t yet :-(</p>
<p>I started to work in Optare in 2007 as an intern. It was a great experience. I learnt so much. I always will be thankful for that. After 4 years and 5 months, I left the company to work as a project manager in a big consultancy firm. I didn&rsquo;t like it. That experience put my ethics and professionalism beyond my limit so, after that, I was completely lost.</p>
<p>And again, Optare came to the rescue offering me to be the tech lead of a new team: NetApps. Cool people called it intrapreneurship or something like that. That has been my major professional success in my career and I don&rsquo;t ever deserve the merit. I resigned the first day as the tech lead to be just another software engineer in the team. It was a team effort from the very beginning and, because of that, it&rsquo;s so special. It isn&rsquo;t one person against the world but a team of highly-skilled engineers collaborating and doing great things.</p>
<p>Once I discovered it was possible to have a happy team, a happy customer and earn money at the same time, I started to evangelize about it. And that&rsquo;s how I ended as technical director. I learnt a lot in this role too. It&rsquo;s easier to build things from scratch than change them once they are built but, sometimes, small impacts are enough to change things in the long term.</p>
<p>So, after 6 years and 1 month, I decided I would look for new challenges again. 10 years and 6 months in total. Wow! I changed a lot. Also the company. But I&rsquo;m very proud of both things. In the case of a company, it&rsquo;s amazing how it has evolved. In my case, It&rsquo;s amazing how my wife and my manager have been able to make me stay in the correct path for so long.</p>
<p>And no! I wasn&rsquo;t unhappy in Optare. That isn&rsquo;t the reason to leave. In fact, I am extremely happy with this company. Honestly, I can&rsquo;t think in any place better to work. Maybe there are some teams which I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend for a specific person, but most of them are great. It&rsquo;s a friendly environment, modern and full of interesting technologies applied to real and challenging architectures.</p>
<p>Also, it has a brilliant future ahead. For a company which has grown so quickly, there will be always up &amp; downs. But Optare is a modern company: medium size, highly-specialized and full of great talent. Any Telecom operator in the world will pay good money once they know what Optare can offer.</p>
<p>But 11 years is a long time, I need a new challenge and I found one where I think I can have a real impact on things I care about: the Tech community and my area. Also the opportunity to work with some cool open-source technologies and continue learning.</p>
<p>So, it hurts a lot but it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye. I&rsquo;m really going to miss you.</p>
