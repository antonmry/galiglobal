# Speaking about Jython in Python Vigo

*01 April 2017*

Some weeks ago I had the opportunity to speak in [the Python Vigo meetup](https://www.python-vigo.es/posts/reunion-del-grupo-el-16032017/). It was just a lightning talk, 5 minutes. Why?. I really enjoy Python Vigo meetups, they are useful, fun and I always learn something new. So, when I read an email asking for speakers, I proposed the only Python related subject I know something about: [Jython](http://www.jython.org/).

I have been using Jython for years to manage Weblogic servers. Being honest, I don't like it, without any doubt I would prefer to use Groovy, in fact, that's what we usually do. But I thought it may be interesting for someone in the Python community.

It was my first time doing a talk so short. Also I'm more used to do them in English. It was clear to me how hard it's to do a 5 minutes talk, even for an easy subject like this.

I just wanted to say three things, if possible, without slides:

- Don't use Jython if you are looking for Python performance improvement.
- Use Jython to explore Java classes or change them dinamically using Python syntax.
- Use Jython to combine it with Java programs, to load configuration dinamically, something like a DSL (Domain Specific Language) but using Python as language.

Probably, the talk wasn't clear for most people... Also I miss 15 seconds more to finish my example. Yet, some people asked me some things later related to it... so I'm not completely sad with the result and I learnt how hard it's to do a good lightning talk.

In case you are insterested, in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/antonmry/talk-pythonvigo-2017-introduction-to-jython) you can find the things I did and also a Readme with the explanation. The talk is recorded so you can watch it here:

Notes for the future:

- Be careful with short talks, they are harder than the long ones.
- Use introductory slides, at least one.
- It's better to say less and clear than more and hard to understand.
