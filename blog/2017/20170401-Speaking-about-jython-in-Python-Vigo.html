        <p><em>01 April 2017</em></p>
        <p>Some weeks ago I had the opportunity to speak in
        <a href="https://www.python-vigo.es/posts/reunion-del-grupo-el-16032017/">the Python Vigo meetup</a>.
        It was just a lightning talk, 5 minutes. Why?. I really enjoy Python Vigo
        meetups, they are useful, fun and I always learn something new. So, when I read
        an email asking for speakers, I proposed the only Python related subject I know
        something about: <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>.</p>
        <p>I have been using Jython for years to manage Weblogic servers. Being honest, I
        don't like it, without any doubt I would prefer to use Groovy, in fact, that's
        what we usually do. But I thought it may be interesting for someone in the
        Python community.</p>
        <p>It was my first time doing a talk so short. Also I'm more used to do them in
        English. It was clear to me how hard it's to do a 5 minutes talk, even for an
        easy subject like this.</p>
        <p>I just wanted to say three things, if possible, without slides:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Don't use Jython if you are looking for Python performance improvement.</li>
        <li>Use Jython to explore Java classes or change them dinamically using Python
          syntax.</li>
        <li>Use Jython to combine it with Java programs, to load configuration
          dinamically, something like a DSL (Domain Specific Language) but using Python
          as language.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Probably, the talk wasn't clear for most people... Also I miss 15 seconds more
        to finish my example. Yet, some people asked me some things later related to
        it... so I'm not completely sad with the result and I learnt how hard it's to do
        a good lightning talk.</p>
        <p>In case you are insterested, in
        <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/talk-pythonvigo-2017-introduction-to-jython">this GitHub repo</a>
        you can find the things I did and also a Readme with the explanation. The talk
        is recorded so you can watch it here:</p>

        <p>Notes for the future:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Be careful with short talks, they are harder than the long ones.</li>
        <li>Use introductory slides, at least one.</li>
        <li>It's better to say less and clear than more and hard to understand.</li>
        </ul>
