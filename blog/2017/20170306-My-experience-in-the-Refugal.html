		<h1>My experience in Refugal</h1>

	<p><em>06 March 2017</em></p>

	<p><p>This weekend I&rsquo;ve participated in the <a href="http://refu.gal/">Refugal</a>, a hackathon for refugees. It isn&rsquo;t the fist time I participate in a hackathon but this one has been special in some way. Do you know those videos of strangers who doesn&rsquo;t know each other but they start to play together in the middle of the station?. Something like this one:</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Y39CwHfOHM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Well, this is exactly what I felt some times during the weekend.</p><p>Let me start in the beginning. I arrived soon and started to speak with people. A nice introduction to the hackathon by <a href="https://twitter.com/dvilchez">David</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/edosadikovic">Edo</a>, a game to improve creativity and we started with the ideas.</p><p>I know I&rsquo;m more a doer than a thinker. But I like to collaborate so I proposed two ideas: a bot to help communicated refugees and volunteers and a network of home webcams interconnected to provide real-time information to the refugees and also to people at home. My presentation of the ideas was quite bad, mainly I was speaking about a bot&hellip; but not all people were developers so later some people told me they didn&rsquo;t know what a bot is. Big fail.</p><p>My &ldquo;bot&rdquo; idea was the third one with more votes. It was another one I liked a lot more (the first one) but I stayed with the bot. Very soon the team was formed: four developers (2 web, 1 mobile and myself) and one designer. It was the more technical team, probably because of my bad explanation of the idea.</p><p>We moved to a room. We discussed the idea for a while in front of a whiteboard and we separated the bot in different sections: Facebook Connector, Telegram Connector, Bot Logic, Design (logo, web, slides, etc.) and DevOps (my part: server, docker, Apache Kafka, etc.). In less than 30 minutes, everything was ready and we were working on the project.</p><p>Hard to explain what happened after that, four guys and a designer working like one person. Lines of code, commands, systems, drawings&hellip; everything happening so fast, <a href="https://github.com/refu-gal/refubot/graphs/commit-activity">133 commits in less than 10 hours</a>. I remember the designer stopping her drawing and asking: &ldquo;Ey, guys, I know some development but I&rsquo;m not understanding what are you are talking about. Is it complex what you are doing?&rdquo;. The four developers in the room said Yes! at the same time. You may take a look to <a href="https://github.com/refu-gal/refubot">github repo</a>: Docker, Docker Compose, AWS, Apache Kafka, four nodeJS and one SQLLite&hellip; Everything integrated and working!. And the designer, what a great work she did. You may have the best backend in the world, but without a good designer, people isn&rsquo;t going to appreciate it. <a href="http://refubot.refu.gal/">The bot web</a> is done by her, nice work!</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a5r3LdOYsH4W6qW3F-wyOAzsaVI5Mgqim6yF64Qeq9zw4K-FRPzQMyVe4QmR-EU4Lwk3HO0I4aDFGyz8a8zfG3a1hZ0nFpHM-cAbJH2YkGm9h8GNFcSa9Dtf-2795D6Avn96gF43keZVLGeqAROMOUlG4Orf-D_n26pbPG5lv9xNWT6Po62hqWMW9WDOobBX1rn0Cv3mjqn7-Yu5l1lCuRTANOrv6U-4DwCD-sKpmFinUYPl8y3y-veH6nB9NORgf0yjBQpr7RO5KSKRrc9fiAOvP63O8_FCpcdV1Zb5U-_DrPPbYtAMwbk50YyhSiaXghcQpJglHlqx7O-NAxZHDxAfoHyVE70w1so_af6v_KZfJBKzdEDUCZQ8rYJuCCQ4CBeK4u-Xe62U598F15e5x3Wb0lYSzSj-M_JBC6-qyqErio9NOKj4_akItup6Vp3_iDy5emavrNr9fuPa7p1lSOqBIg31LkR1Gz5y_skIV5iitaJS9HXa8D_NJS17gnUngIgCrI2s0vsbVZ753AhZFFOXdEqYwsI6LOuMhhwntmHdQa7Jcf1nmn5ybkt9qwSwYf7YNRy1iugRpg7DMIQOR6iffrQklAXfRSIbdeUKV0ytCKlftlk8UFR4DlN4JaZU0WbnMz4upj8mkK5xFzZE51o8NIbQEsCWwEH6vEXR=w1287-h965-no" alt="Working as a team""/></p><p>From time to time someone proposing something: always accepted or postponed to the end if there was time for that. And back to work, not even a discussion in the whole weekend. Sometimes we even forget go to eat (but a great organization and <a href="http://vigo.impacthub.net/en/">the impacthub Vigo is so cool</a>!). Also we had some funny moments, smiles and lot of complicity.</p><p>I even had time to add a SMS connector using Nexmo, the best 15 euros spent in my life. First time I develop something using nodejs. I don&rsquo;t like it yet but I have to say it was a good decision for the project: lot of libraries and SDKs, easy to deploy and fast to develop.</p><p>Of course, we run the demo during the presentation, it was great to see people sending messages from different networks and speaking with our bot. So fun!. I will pay good money for a video of that moment but everybody was too busy sending messages.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wEfS8qxIqm0Jg01y6C3t6wDnZslQz4-FsHs1gPuzqXxR51gH_xkSu7wZCAJ_9JYYZUteo0FvF2ThF_8XBuLcDtS0zKrnpz2AdARMVps7eCHgnaFxzKnyMp5KPerV7KOzhlJg1wX8avgpu7injwgz_0oiYLO7VIRs-uYDW8s_GavTiafJ3EpwftWJqP6sH-o9KmQRntwBuZt8QbggBhF7HWw4377Soc9GKm3mNsocqALa6Sl9Zwa5BFlZ-LnPQjp8Y2WA8_FVVq_KJdV0EzF8U4yEgcSkOlzZsiEShfcyfAwIF_NShDlOH-qYz8o22hF1rFP303zfoBfdSzuddIyD1jpMP9oRRAoQMEu7EuGEejp28Rz-GvzvbmgsJyvD3XzmuJgU-vJcq_es2D4PXabR9oHR_xQJXku2ip697ZiKrIhSlc0ye3oLFpANwC_Od_CiLp1m3NUG7KZ-vsf0BvfwYLrj1MURv2cRjChTXNTZ62LXXFbQv2uqUPWIdUlNVYcGrYoSg3lhWsCqzl3xm_80T5DDQOxyMavjJ7T4KwK-vN5CoFSiB3HSuy0NA__nUXYhhk6fudr1cw5myfyURuicvGjg1J9LD2NkbgSusyjPSgqVJqhBW4L84Q3cwMBJmcdFl921U-kD_iFRBG7VWYarTsWPPZ1i1mA_eoQCt8BRww=w1448-h965-no" alt="RefuBot presentation""/></p><p>This morning, when I terminated the EC2 instance hosting the bot, I felt some type of sadness. Yet it has been great to meet such great team this weekend. And who knows?. RefuBot works and it scales. I can assure that. Maybe someone will discover it in the future and RefuBot becomes real. If it&rsquo;s really useful, that would be fair.</p><p><em>Photos are from <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMDKf-GpnBzjFBII47B_Yoy5jOUpFqM1_agHANPrlG3CcKsbba09EcMIeZNP_R3sA?key=cllPNDJFMjlTYWtybXNIZ01PT1RMSWpabU5LVFF3">this Picassa album</a></em>.</p></p>
