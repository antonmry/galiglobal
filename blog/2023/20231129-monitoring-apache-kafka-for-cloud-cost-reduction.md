# Monitoring Apache Kafka for cloud cost reduction

*29 October 2023*

I've published my first article in the New Relic blog!
[Monitoring Apache Kafka for cloud cost reduction](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/monitoring-apache-kafka-for-cloud-cost-reduction)
is a summary of some of the initiatives I've been working on since I joined New
Relic 2.5 years ago.

It has been a very interesting journey and I've learnt a lot in the process. In
particular about Cloud providers and how to tune Kafka servers and huge
workloads for them.
