        <p><em>28 February 2021</em></p>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>One of the most important concepts for stream-processing frameworks is the
        concept of time. There are different concepts of time:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Processing time</strong>: it's the time-based on the clock of the machine where the
          event is being processed. It's easy to use but because that time changes when
          the job is executed, the result of the job isn't consistent. Each time you
          execute the job, you may have different results. This isn't an acceptable
          trade-off for many use cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Event time</strong>: it's the time-based on some of the fields in the event,
          typically a timestamp field. Each time you execute the pipeline with the same
          input, you obtain the same result which it's a good thing. But it also tends
          to be a bit harder to work with it for several reasons. We'll cover them later
          in the article.</li>
        <li><strong>Ingestion time</strong>: it's based on the timestamp when the event was ingested in
          the streaming platform (Kafka) and it usually goes in the metadata. From a
          Flink perspective, we can consider it a particular mix of Event time and
          processing time with the disadvantages of both.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://flink.apache.org/">Apache Flink</a> has excellent support for Event time
        processing, probably the best of the different stream-processing frameworks
        available. For more information, you can read
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/concepts/timely-stream-processing.html#notions-of-time-event-time-and-processing-time">Notions of Time: Event Time and Processing Time</a>
        in the official documentation. If you prefer videos,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVDJFZVHZ3c">Streaming Concepts &amp; Introduction to Flink - Event Time and Watermarks</a>
        is a good explanation.</p>
        <p>In this article, we'll take a look at Event time based pipelines and also to
        some common problems and misunderstandings working on this type of pipelines.</p>
        <h2 id="timestamps-and-watermarks">Timestamps and watermarks</h2>
        <p>When we speak about timestamps in Flink, we are referring to a particular field
        in the event. We can extract it and make it available to Flink so it knows
        what's the actual time from the pipeline perspective. The format expected by
        Flink is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>, specified as
        milliseconds since the Java epoch of 1970-01-01T00 :00:00Z, so we may need to do
        some type of conversion. To be able to map current time with the event
        timestamp, Flink expects an implementation of the
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/api/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/eventtime/TimestampAssigner.html">TimestampAssigner</a>.
        We'll see later an example.</p>
        <p>Once Flink knows what time it is, it's the moment to generate a watermark. This
        is one of the most surprising and genial thinks working with Flink. A watermark
        is a special type of event. That means, it flows through your job and it's
        processed under the hood for each task. This is a clever way to propagate a
        change through the entire pipeline and it's used for more things in flink, like
        for example
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/ops/state/savepoints.html">savepoints</a>.</p>
        <p>Generate watermarks is the way to tell the system about progress in event time.
        To do it, you use a
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/api/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/eventtime/WatermarkGenerator.html">WatermarkGenerator</a>.
        We'll see later an example.</p>
        <p>Both together,
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/api/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/eventtime/TimestampAssigner.html">TimestampAssigner</a>
        and
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/api/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/eventtime/WatermarkGenerator.html">WatermarkGenerator</a>
        form a
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/api/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/eventtime/WatermarkStrategy.html">WatermarkStrategy</a>
        which defines how to generate Watermarks in the stream sources.</p>
        <h2 id="use-case-example">Use case example</h2>
        <p>Let's illustrate this with an example. Our flink job will receive readings from
        different sensors. Every sensor will send measures for each 100ms. We would like
        to detect when a measure from a particular sensor is missing, for example,
        because it was off-line.</p>
        <p>Sensors send a JSON file like this one:</p>
        <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-json">{
          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;sensor0&quot;,
          &quot;timestamp&quot;: 0,
          &quot;measure&quot;: 0.1
        }
        </code></pre>

        <p>The job will generate a normal event but the measure value will have value -1
        when the event wasn't generated by the sensor or lost in the network.</p>
        <h2 id="initial-implementation-with-periodic-watermark-generators">Initial implementation with periodic watermark generators</h2>
        <p>We'll have to choose a
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/api/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/eventtime/WatermarkStrategy.html">WatermarkStrategy</a>.
        We have several options, let's start with Periodic WatermarkGenerator:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>WatermarkStrategy.
          <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/event_timestamp_extractors.html#fixed-amount-of-lateness">forBoundedOutOfOrderness</a>:
          this is a periodic generator that allows dealing with records out of order
          when it's inside a defined range.</li>
        <li>WatermarkStrategy.
          <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/event_timestamp_extractors.html#monotonously-increasing-timestamps">forMonotonousTimestamps</a>:
          this is the same as
          <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/event_timestamp_extractors.html#fixed-amount-of-lateness">forBoundedOutOfOrderness</a>
          but the out-of-order tolerance is zero.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In both cases, the framework invokes periodically the Strategy which generates
        the watermark. <code>setAutoWatermarkInterval</code> allows lo define that periodicity:</p>
        <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-java">env.getConfig().setAutoWatermarkInterval(Duration.ofMillis(100).toMillis());
        </code></pre>

        <p>The problem with this approach is we are mixing processing and event time so the
        result won't be deterministic, or even correct depending on the circumstances.</p>
        <p>For example, with
        <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/flink-playground/blob/main/src/main/java/galiglobal/flink/eventTime/BoundedOutOfOrdernessStrategyJob.java">BoundedOutOfOrdernessStrategyJob</a>,
        we start defining the watermark interval each 100 ms.</p>
        <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-java">env.getConfig().setAutoWatermarkInterval(Duration.ofMillis(100).toMillis());
        </code></pre>

        <p>Then we create the DataStream with the watermarks:</p>
        <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-java">DataStream&lt;SensorData&gt; sensorStream =
            env.addSource(source)
                .returns(TypeInformation.of(SensorData.class));

        var sensorEventTimeStream =
            sensorStream.assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(
                WatermarkStrategy.&lt;SensorData&gt;forBoundedOutOfOrderness(
                    Duration.ofMillis(100)
                ).withTimestampAssigner(
                    (event, timestamp) -&gt; event.getTimestamp()
                )
            );
        </code></pre>

        <p>To detect missing events, we used a timer so we need a keyed stream and a
        KeyedProcessFunction:</p>
        <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-java">sensorEventTimeStream
            .keyBy((event) -&gt; event.getId())
            .process(new TimeoutFunction())
            .addSink(sink);
        </code></pre>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/antonmry/flink-playground/blob/main/src/main/java/galiglobal/flink/eventTime/TimeoutFunction.java">TimeoutFunction</a>
        stores each event in the state and creates a timer for each one. It cancels the
        timer if the next event arrives on time. If not, <code>onTimer</code> should be invoked and
        the event in the state identifying the missing sensor is emitted.</p>
        <h2 id="testing-and-debugging-the-first-implementation">Testing and debugging the first implementation</h2>
        <p>Let's create a simple test: two sensors and one of them misses one of the
        measures. When we launch the test
        <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/flink-playground/blob/main/src/test/java/galiglobal/flink/eventTime/StreamingJobTest.java#L24">testBoundedOutOfOrdernessStrategyJob</a>,
        we obtain the following result:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Timer: 500 -&gt; sensor0<br />
        Timer: 500 -&gt; sensor1<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=0, measure=0.1}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor1', timestamp=0, measure=0.2}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=100, measure=0.3}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor1', timestamp=100, measure=0.4}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=200, measure=0.5}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=300, measure=0.7}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor1', timestamp=300, measure=0.8}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=400, measure=0.9}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor1', timestamp=400, measure=1.0}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=500, measure=-1.0}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor1', timestamp=500, measure=-1.0}</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The job doesn't detect the missing event but it detects the end of the stream.
        Why? It's time to do some debugging. Debug watermarks issues isn't easy. There
        are three options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Check the current watermark metric. See
          <a href="https://www.galiglobal.com/blog/2021/20210130-Flink-setup.html#metrics">my previous article about the Flink setup</a>.
          This is ideal for real jobs but a bit more complicated with tests because they
          finish almost immediately.</li>
        <li>Check the current watermark in the Flink UI: as with the previous one, it
          doesn't work with tests if they finish too quickly.</li>
        <li>Introduce a custom operator which has access to the current watermark. I used
          this one which allows us also to play with some more advanced operators.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img alt="Flink UI" src="eventtime-flink.png" title="Flink UI"></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/antonmry/flink-playground/blob/main/src/main/java/galiglobal/flink/eventTime/StreamWatermarkDebugFilter.java">StreamWatermarkDebugFilter</a>
        is the internal class
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/api/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/operators/StreamFilter.html">StreamFilter</a>
        with some minor modifications:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We don't want to filter any event. This could be improved a bit avoiding the
          filtering but because it's a class only for debugging, I didn't care too much.</li>
        <li>In the method <code>processWatermark</code>, emit the watermark to be consumed for the
          next operator and print it for debugging purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We apply the new operator to the job:</p>
        <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-java">sensorEventTimeStream
            .transform(&quot;debugFilter&quot;, sensorEventTimeStream.getType(), new StreamWatermarkDebugFilter&lt;&gt;())
            .keyBy((event) -&gt; event.getId())
            .process(new TimeoutFunction())
            .addSink(sink);
        </code></pre>

        <p>We can see the watermarks generated executing the test again:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Watermark: 9223372036854775807</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Only one watermark is generated: <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code>. This watermark seems to be
        executed at the end of the job because it's the bigger possible watermark. This
        is consequent with the last two timers we see. They are launched with timestamp
        500 but there is no watermark with that value: it's just the end of the job.</p>
        <p>So the Watermark generator isn't generating a watermark. The only reason I see
        for that it's because the job is ending before any watermark is generated. We
        could set the periodic generation with a smaller value but the problem remains:
        we are mixing processing and event time so it's really hard to know how the
        pipeline is going to proceed in some conditions.</p>
        <h2 id="final-implementation-with-a-punctuated-watermarkgenerator">Final implementation with a Punctuated WatermarkGenerator</h2>
        <p>We are going to create a generator which will be able to generate watermarks
        based in the elements of the stream: a
        <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.html#writing-a-punctuated-watermarkgenerator">Punctuated WatermarkGenerator</a>.
        So we create a new job
        <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/flink-playground/blob/main/src/main/java/galiglobal/flink/eventTime/CustomStrategyJob.java">CustomStrategyJob</a>:</p>
        <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-java">var sensorEventTimeStream =
            sensorStream
                .assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(
                    new WatermarkStrategy&lt;SensorData&gt;() {
                        @Override
                        public WatermarkGenerator&lt;SensorData&gt; createWatermarkGenerator(
                            WatermarkGeneratorSupplier.Context context) {
                            return new BoundedOutOfOrdernessWatermarks&lt;&gt;(
                                Duration.ofMillis(0)
                            ) {
                                @Override
                                public void onEvent(
                                    SensorData event,
                                    long eventTimestamp,
                                    WatermarkOutput output) {
                                    super.onEvent(event, eventTimestamp, output);
                                    super.onPeriodicEmit(output);
                                }
                            };
                        }
                    }
                        .withTimestampAssigner((event, timestamp) -&gt; event.getTimestamp())
                );
        </code></pre>

        <p>It's similar to <code>BoundedOutOfOrdernessWatermarks</code> but we modify the method
        <code>onEvent</code> to invoke <code>onPeriodicEmit</code> which emits the watermark. So, instead of
        being invoked by the framework, now it emits a new watermark each time it
        receives an event.</p>
        <p><img alt="Flink Pipeline with Punctuated Generator" src="eventtime-pipeline.png" title="Flink Pipeline with Punctuated Generator"></p>
        <p>The test produces the following output now:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Watermark: -1<br />
        Watermark: -1<br />
        Watermark: 99<br />
        Watermark: 99<br />
        Watermark: 199<br />
        Watermark: 299<br />
        Watermark: 299<br />
        Watermark: 399<br />
        Watermark: 399<br />
        Watermark: 9223372036854775807<br />
        Watermark: 9223372036854775807</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This seems a lot better but there is a problem. We don't have a watermark
        generated for the sensor 0 at 199. The problem here it's our stream is keyed, so
        it's being processed by two different tasks. Watermarks generations works per
        task so they don't advance at the same time. To solve this, the easier way is to
        set parallelism to 1. Unfortunately, this approach isn't very efficient.</p>
        <p>Relaunching the test, we obtain the expected result:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=0, measure=0.1}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor1', timestamp=0, measure=0.2}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=100, measure=0.3}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor1', timestamp=100, measure=0.4}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=200, measure=0.5}<br />
        SensorData{id='sensor0', timestamp=300, measure=0.7}<br /></p>
