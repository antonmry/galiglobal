# Introduction to OCSG SDK

*26 May 2014*

As part of the activities we did for the
[TADHack 2014](http://tadhack.com/2014/), I've recorded
[this short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvVYH-tpEw8) about the
Oracle Communications Services Gatekeeper SDK:

This is a very interesting tool for developers, a lot of people asked us for it
and Oracle allow us to distribute it between the TADHack participants... It can
made a big different for a CSP trying to engage developers.

More information is available in the
[Oracle® Communications Services Gatekeeper SDK User's Guide Release 5.1](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36135_01/doc.51/e37529/toc.htm)
