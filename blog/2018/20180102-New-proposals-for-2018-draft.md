# My goals for 2018: more focus

*02 January 2018*

Third year in a row writing my proposals for the new year, yeah!. Again I'm not
going to spend time reviewing the previous year, I let that for "internal use".

There is something I've discovered in 2017 which wasn't planned (or correctly
estimated): my family require more time from me now than ever. "Family first" is
a motto very respected by me (and my employer) so I had to restrict a lot of
things of my life to focus on that. Now I'm more aware of it, so I will continue
with the "family first" approach but I will try to do it in a more maintainable
way: I have to focus more, be more realistic and have more help.

My first proposal for 2018 is recover my healthy style of life. I never in my
life did so less sport as the past year. From 4-5 days per week in 2016 to 1 (or
even less) in 2017. As a result, I have also to loose weight. I'm even surprised
I was able to maintain my positive attitude with that "stress burning" low rate.
This proposal isn't very original but it's important.

Second goal, my work in [Optare Solutions](https://www.optaresolutions.com). I
will continue for a while (but not forever) as Technical Director. It's a
challenging role which I've accepted to make things happen even if, ironically,
I see it as step back in my career. I'm very happy with some "small victories"
in the past year (which are a team effort, not mine) as open new offices in
Ourense, sponsor the VigoJUG and the GDGDevFest, provide the facilities to make
a k8s workshop organised by VigoLabs, improvements in the workflow of some
teams, [the Abbilia initiative](http://abbilia.optaresolutions.com/) and, the
most important, start to think as group (or even better, a big family) how to
improve the company embracing continuous improvement instead of making
individual efforts in silos or too big programs.

Yet, big cultural changes take time. Optare is a great place to work, the bar is
really high to make a real difference because it's a company with a long history
of successes and well done projects so change the formula, even to improve it,
is a complex task. I think we are very lucky to have a company like this in
Galicia and I will continue to help it as much as possible.

I also will continue also contributing to
[NetApps](http://optaresolutions.com/unidades-de-negocio/network-apps-bu/), an
Optare's team where I have been working for years now and where I can share time
and experiences with some of the best engineers I've ever met. My work as
Technical Manager is quite lonely so this part-time role allows me to continue
doing some "real world" work and recharge batteries when needed. I'm very
thankful for that. This is going to be a great year for this team, I'm really
excited and looking forward to the new challenges.

Last, but not least, I want to continue contributing to the local community:

Co-organize the [VigoJUG](http://www.vigojug.org) has been a great experience. I
will like to continue it with a clear goal: my vision (I'm not the only
organizer) for the JUG is a group of friends who share time and knowledge. I
personally would like to keep it in that way. Make something bigger is a
temptation but I don't believe it will work in the long term.

Also, I will like to launch the CoruñaJUG. I will be more present in that city
in 2018 but don't be afraid, I will continue cheering the
[Celta soccer team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celta_de_Vigo).

The previous year I've spent some time helping to launch
[VigoTech Alliance](http://www.vigotech.org). It seems
[VigoTech as project](https://github.com/orgs/VigoTech/projects/1) is ended,
most of the proposals to improve it have been rejected or ignored, which it's
fine: it means it's good as it is. I will continue supporting the Alliance when
needed but I don't expect to spent too much time on it in 2018 (but I will be
happy to be wrong it there are new initiatives).

I have also spoken in several local meetups as
[ForoDeEmprego](http://www.forotecnoloxico.net/),
[VigoLabs](https://twitter.com/vigolabs),
[GDGDevFest](http://devfest.gdggalicia.com/), [Librecon](https://librecon.io/),
[PythonVigo](https://www.python-vigo.es/), and, of course,
[VigoJUG](http://www.vigojug.org), and participated in hackathons (Refugal,
GPUL). I'm very happy with this. It's funny I did the opposite of the normal
path: started in international conferences speaking in English, and then, move
to local ones speaking in my mother tongue. I met great people and I did things
I never through I would do it (as a motivational talk). I will try to continue
that path as much as possible but I probably will need to slow down a bit.

Finally, last year I tried to contribute to some big open source projects
(Kafka, Elastic, Lucene). It makes sense for several reasons but I failed. It
requires some constancy and I just could dedicate time very occasionally. Out of
the office, I spent most of the time playing with frameworks, testing new tools
or reading books. I also did some MOOCs (Scala and Oracle Cloud). Learn for the
simple pleasure of learn is my passion. I would like to do some serious PRs in
2018 but it's going to be impossible :-(

Instead of that, I will try to update more frequently the blog with technical
content. I've reading a lot about JVM performance in the last months, I have
some experience and it's a interesting subject for the blog. I will also try to
attend a couple of international events related to the JVM. And, only if I have
time, try to do some open source contributions in that field.

In summary, my proposal for 2018 is to be more focused in some things and let
others pass. Happy 2018!
