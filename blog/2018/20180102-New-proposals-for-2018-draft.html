        <p><em>02 January 2018</em></p>
        <p>Third year in a row writing my proposals for the new year, yeah!. Again I'm not
        going to spend time reviewing the previous year, I let that for "internal use".</p>
        <p>There is something I've discovered in 2017 which wasn't planned (or correctly
        estimated): my family require more time from me now than ever. "Family first" is
        a motto very respected by me (and my employer) so I had to restrict a lot of
        things of my life to focus on that. Now I'm more aware of it, so I will continue
        with the "family first" approach but I will try to do it in a more maintainable
        way: I have to focus more, be more realistic and have more help.</p>
        <p>My first proposal for 2018 is recover my healthy style of life. I never in my
        life did so less sport as the past year. From 4-5 days per week in 2016 to 1 (or
        even less) in 2017. As a result, I have also to loose weight. I'm even surprised
        I was able to maintain my positive attitude with that "stress burning" low rate.
        This proposal isn't very original but it's important.</p>
        <p>Second goal, my work in <a href="https://www.optaresolutions.com">Optare Solutions</a>. I
        will continue for a while (but not forever) as Technical Director. It's a
        challenging role which I've accepted to make things happen even if, ironically,
        I see it as step back in my career. I'm very happy with some "small victories"
        in the past year (which are a team effort, not mine) as open new offices in
        Ourense, sponsor the VigoJUG and the GDGDevFest, provide the facilities to make
        a k8s workshop organised by VigoLabs, improvements in the workflow of some
        teams, <a href="http://abbilia.optaresolutions.com/">the Abbilia initiative</a> and, the
        most important, start to think as group (or even better, a big family) how to
        improve the company embracing continuous improvement instead of making
        individual efforts in silos or too big programs.</p>
        <p>Yet, big cultural changes take time. Optare is a great place to work, the bar is
        really high to make a real difference because it's a company with a long history
        of successes and well done projects so change the formula, even to improve it,
        is a complex task. I think we are very lucky to have a company like this in
        Galicia and I will continue to help it as much as possible.</p>
        <p>I also will continue also contributing to
        <a href="http://optaresolutions.com/unidades-de-negocio/network-apps-bu/">NetApps</a>, an
        Optare's team where I have been working for years now and where I can share time
        and experiences with some of the best engineers I've ever met. My work as
        Technical Manager is quite lonely so this part-time role allows me to continue
        doing some "real world" work and recharge batteries when needed. I'm very
        thankful for that. This is going to be a great year for this team, I'm really
        excited and looking forward to the new challenges.</p>
        <p>Last, but not least, I want to continue contributing to the local community:</p>
        <p>Co-organize the <a href="http://www.vigojug.org">VigoJUG</a> has been a great experience. I
        will like to continue it with a clear goal: my vision (I'm not the only
        organizer) for the JUG is a group of friends who share time and knowledge. I
        personally would like to keep it in that way. Make something bigger is a
        temptation but I don't believe it will work in the long term.</p>
        <p>Also, I will like to launch the CoruñaJUG. I will be more present in that city
        in 2018 but don't be afraid, I will continue cheering the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celta_de_Vigo">Celta soccer team</a>.</p>
        <p>The previous year I've spent some time helping to launch
        <a href="http://www.vigotech.org">VigoTech Alliance</a>. It seems
        <a href="https://github.com/orgs/VigoTech/projects/1">VigoTech as project</a> is ended,
        most of the proposals to improve it have been rejected or ignored, which it's
        fine: it means it's good as it is. I will continue supporting the Alliance when
        needed but I don't expect to spent too much time on it in 2018 (but I will be
        happy to be wrong it there are new initiatives).</p>
        <p>I have also spoken in several local meetups as
        <a href="http://www.forotecnoloxico.net/">ForoDeEmprego</a>,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/vigolabs">VigoLabs</a>,
        <a href="http://devfest.gdggalicia.com/">GDGDevFest</a>, <a href="https://librecon.io/">Librecon</a>,
        <a href="https://www.python-vigo.es/">PythonVigo</a>, and, of course,
        <a href="http://www.vigojug.org">VigoJUG</a>, and participated in hackathons (Refugal,
        GPUL). I'm very happy with this. It's funny I did the opposite of the normal
        path: started in international conferences speaking in English, and then, move
        to local ones speaking in my mother tongue. I met great people and I did things
        I never through I would do it (as a motivational talk). I will try to continue
        that path as much as possible but I probably will need to slow down a bit.</p>
        <p>Finally, last year I tried to contribute to some big open source projects
        (Kafka, Elastic, Lucene). It makes sense for several reasons but I failed. It
        requires some constancy and I just could dedicate time very occasionally. Out of
        the office, I spent most of the time playing with frameworks, testing new tools
        or reading books. I also did some MOOCs (Scala and Oracle Cloud). Learn for the
        simple pleasure of learn is my passion. I would like to do some serious PRs in
        2018 but it's going to be impossible :-(</p>
        <p>Instead of that, I will try to update more frequently the blog with technical
        content. I've reading a lot about JVM performance in the last months, I have
        some experience and it's a interesting subject for the blog. I will also try to
        attend a couple of international events related to the JVM. And, only if I have
        time, try to do some open source contributions in that field.</p>
        <p>In summary, my proposal for 2018 is to be more focused in some things and let
        others pass. Happy 2018!</p>
