		<h1>My goals for 2018: more focus</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>02 January 2018</em></p>

	<p><p>Third year in a row writing my proposals for the new year, yeah!. Again I&rsquo;m not going to spend time reviewing the previous year, I let that for &ldquo;internal use&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There is something I&rsquo;ve discovered in 2017 which wasn&rsquo;t planned (or correctly estimated): my family require more time from me now than ever. &ldquo;Family first&rdquo; is a motto very respected by me (and my employer) so I had to restrict a lot of things of my life to focus on that. Now I&rsquo;m more aware of it, so I will continue with the &ldquo;family first&rdquo; approach but I will try to do it in a more maintainable way: I have to focus more, be more realistic and have more help.</p>
<p>My first proposal for 2018 is recover my healthy style of life. I never in my life did so less sport as the past year. From 4-5 days per week in 2016 to 1 (or even less) in 2017. As a result, I have also to loose weight. I&rsquo;m even surprised I was able to maintain my positive attitude with that &ldquo;stress burning&rdquo; low rate. This proposal isn&rsquo;t very original but it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Second goal, my work in <a href="https://www.optaresolutions.com">Optare Solutions</a>. I will continue for a while (but not forever) as Technical Director. It&rsquo;s a challenging role which I&rsquo;ve accepted to make things happen even if, ironically, I see it as step back in my career. I&rsquo;m very happy with some &ldquo;small victories&rdquo; in the past year (which are a team effort, not mine) as open new offices in Ourense, sponsor the VigoJUG and the GDGDevFest, provide the facilities to make a k8s workshop organised by VigoLabs, improvements in the workflow of some teams, <a href="http://abbilia.optaresolutions.com/">the Abbilia initiative</a> and, the most important, start to think as group (or even better, a big family) how to improve the company embracing continuous improvement instead of making individual efforts in silos or too big programs.</p>
<p>Yet, big cultural changes take time. Optare is a great place to work, the bar is really high to make a real difference because it&rsquo;s a company with a long history of successes and well done projects so change the formula, even to improve it, is a complex task. I think we are very lucky to have a company like this in Galicia and I will continue to help it as much as possible.</p>
<p>I also will continue also contributing to <a href="http://optaresolutions.com/unidades-de-negocio/network-apps-bu/">NetApps</a>, an Optare&rsquo;s team where I have been working for years now and where I can share time and experiences with some of the best engineers I&rsquo;ve ever met. My work as Technical Manager is quite lonely so this part-time role allows me to continue doing some &ldquo;real world&rdquo; work and recharge batteries when needed. I&rsquo;m very thankful for that. This is going to be a great year for this team, I&rsquo;m really excited and looking forward to the new challenges.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I want to continue contributing to the local community:</p>
<p>Co-organize the <a href="http://www.vigojug.org">VigoJUG</a> has been a great experience. I will like to continue it with a clear goal: my vision (I&rsquo;m not the only organizer) for the JUG is a group of friends who share time and knowledge. I personally would like to keep it in that way. Make something bigger is a temptation but I don&rsquo;t believe it will work in the long term.</p>
<p>Also, I will like to launch the Coru√±aJUG. I will be more present in that city in 2018 but don&rsquo;t be afraid, I will continue cheering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celta_de_Vigo">Celta soccer team</a>.</p>
<p>The previous year I&rsquo;ve spent some time helping to launch <a href="http://www.vigotech.org">VigoTech Alliance</a>. It seems <a href="https://github.com/orgs/VigoTech/projects/1">VigoTech as project</a> is ended, most of the proposals to improve it have been rejected or ignored, which it&rsquo;s fine: it means it&rsquo;s good as it is. I will continue supporting the Alliance when needed but I don&rsquo;t expect to spent too much time on it in 2018 (but I will be happy to be wrong it there are new initiatives).</p>
<p>I have also spoken in several local meetups as <a href="http://www.forotecnoloxico.net/">ForoDeEmprego</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vigolabs">VigoLabs</a>, <a href="http://devfest.gdggalicia.com/">GDGDevFest</a>, <a href="https://librecon.io/">Librecon</a>, <a href="https://www.python-vigo.es/">PythonVigo</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://www.vigojug.org">VigoJUG</a>, and participated in hackathons (Refugal, GPUL). I&rsquo;m very happy with this. It&rsquo;s funny I did the opposite of the normal path: started in international conferences speaking in English, and then, move to local ones speaking in my mother tongue. I met great people and I did things I never through I would do it (as a motivational talk). I will try to continue that path as much as possible but I probably will need to slow down a bit.</p>
<p>Finally, last year I tried to contribute to some big open source projects (Kafka, Elastic, Lucene). It makes sense for several reasons but I failed. It requires some constancy and I just could dedicate time very occasionally. Out of the office, I spent most of the time playing with frameworks, testing new tools or reading books. I also did some MOOCs (Scala and Oracle Cloud). Learn for the simple pleasure of learn is my passion. I would like to do some serious PRs in 2018 but it&rsquo;s going to be impossible :-(</p>
<p>Instead of that, I will try to update more frequently the blog with technical content. I&rsquo;ve reading a lot about JVM performance in the last months, I have some experience and it&rsquo;s a interesting subject for the blog. I will also try to attend a couple of international events related to the JVM. And, only if I have time, try to do some open source contributions in that field.</p>
<p>In summary, my proposal for 2018 is to be more focused in some things and let others pass. Happy 2018!</p>
