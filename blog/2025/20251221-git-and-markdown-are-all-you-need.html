        <p><em>21 December 2025</em></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Lately I've been creating and using personal software in a different way, and
        it has become a pattern: Git to store and sync, Markdown to write, and a few
        tiny scripts to glue everything together. No frameworks, no databases, no
        vendors. Writing it down might help anyone who wants a simple, portable setup
        they fully own.</p>
        <h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>
        <p>It all started with Obsidian, my notes system. It isn't anything fancy: just a
        private repo on GitHub. I still use the mobile app, but after a while I dropped
        the desktop app and switched to Neovim with
        <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/dotfiles/blob/main/config/nvim/ftplugin/markdown.lua#L23">moxide LSP</a>.</p>
        <p>This has been working well for me. Using git to sync between machines is pretty
        natural, even on the phone using <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a> and a simple
        Bash script launched from a homescreen shortcut.</p>
        <p>Every day the app on the phone generates a new entry from a
        template with the tasks I do and the sections I like to keep updated.</p>
        <p>I wanted the entries from my calendars too, so I vibe-coded a simple Python
        script that reads from Google Calendar and creates the file. Every day a GitHub
        Actions workflow generates the file at 4:00AM and commits to GitHub. This could
        be done in a million ways, but this one was particularly easy and works well.</p>
        <h2 id="that-project-i-never-had-time-for">That project I never had time for</h2>
        <p>After that, I decided I also wanted a daily report of the news I follow:
        BlueSky, blogs, releases in GitHub, etc. I still miss Google Reader. Again, I
        created <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/news">a repo on GitHub</a>, vibe-coded a
        couple of Python scripts, a daily GitHub Actions workflow and an HTML page, and
        I have now
        <a href="https://news.anton.galiglobal.com">my own site of news curated for me</a>. I'm
        even using GitHub AI models to summarize the longer entries. It couldn't be
        easier!</p>
        <p><img alt="Anton news" src="anton-news.jpg"></p>
        <p>Finally, I did the same with my blog. Dealing with Hugo (and don't ask me about
        JBake) was frustrating and time consuming. Now it's just a couple of vibe-coded
        Python scripts with <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> and it's done. I also
        added RSS and comments from Leaflet (big thanks to
        <a href="https://sharpmars.nekoweb.org/blog/hooking-into-leaflet">SharpMars</a> for the
        idea!). Combining this approach with <a href="https://atproto.com">at-proto</a> services
        like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anton.galiglobal.com">BlueSky</a> or
        <a href="https://blog.anton.galiglobal.com">Leaflet</a> works really well for me.</p>
        <p>Git keeps me portable: I can move easily to any Git host (GitHub,
        <a href="https://tangled.org/">Tangled</a>, whatever comes next) and I can host it with
        GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages on my own domain. It also works great with the
        GitHub app. I use it to navigate the repo, search, make changes, or explore my
        notes with an AI agent in the app. I can evolve the setup with the functionality
        that matters to me and I'm the owner of the whole thing. I don't depend on a
        company and I'm not exposed to ads in the process. The stack is boring by
        design: text files, Git history, and a browser. That keeps the surface small,
        the backups easy, and the odds of future breakage low.</p>
        <h2 id="ai-is-changing-how-we-consume-software">AI is changing how we consume software</h2>
        <p>None of this is rocket science. It breaks, but it's easy to fix: a quick prompt
        and a code agent usually solve it. When something fails, I paste the error into
        an AI prompt, get a patch, and move on. Most issues are wiring problems, not
        architecture problems, so the fixes are fast.</p>
        <p>The same pattern shows up on my workstation. I tried several apps to lower the
        burden of reviewing PRs. I even used
        <a href="https://github.com/danobi/prr">prr</a>, but having to create a personal token was
        a problem. Nowadays I use a
        <a href="https://github.com/antonmry/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/review.sh">Bash script</a> with
        the GitHub CLI to review PRs and it works really well. It allows me to review
        PRs quickly and properly from the terminal. I can't live without it!</p>
        <p>With more software than ever, my bar to install something new is ridiculously
        high. Most of what a fancy app offers I can get with the tools I've always used
        (Neovim, Alacritty, ZelliJ and Firefox) plus a handful of vibe-coded scripts.
        It's easier for me because I don't have to learn another tool, and easier for
        the agent because it already knows how to work with these boring, well-known
        ones. It's almost 2026 and I spend more time in the terminal than ever. The
        only app I keep open all day is Slack, and thanks to Recap I spend less time in
        it than ever.</p>
        <p>These simple utilities shape how I see the future of software: solid building
        blocks, open source, highly adaptable to the user, and easy to wire together
        with Git and Markdown. It is often faster to vibe-code a 30-line script than to
        bend a complex app like Hugo or a full IDE into doing what you want. Owning the
        small pieces keeps you in control and keeps the stack understandable years
        later.</p>
