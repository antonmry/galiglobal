		<h1>My goals for 2020: survive and build</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>09 March 2020</em></p>

	<p><p>Last year I didn&rsquo;t write about one of my goals: to find a new job. I didn&rsquo;t want to make it public and it took more than I was expecting.</p>
<p>This year is very different. I made a big change in my career: from a role more oriented to manage and spread good development/deployment practices I have moved to a Data Engineering role. The reason to do that it was to avoid overlapping with other persons in my organization so nowadays I spent my time working with several cool technologies as Kafka or Spark. I&rsquo;m having fun and I don&rsquo;t miss too much Jenkins, Kubernetes or API Gateways. In the end, that&rsquo;s what I like: learn new things more than work in specific areas for years.</p>
<p>So my role for this year is clear: I just want to contribute as much as possible and wait for an opportunity to build great things. In some point in the future I would like to build again something as the NetApps team: a highly skilled team able to do whatever it&rsquo;s necessary and have fun at the same time. That&rsquo;s a complex goal which requires several factors, I don&rsquo;t think 2020 is going to be the year for that. It&rsquo;s time to be patient and build the bases for the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the community, I&rsquo;m very happy with the CoruñaJUG. We are building a solid community and we can say it&rsquo;s quite stable now. The main goal for the JUG now is to have better defined &ldquo;core members&rdquo; which, at some point, could continue with the JUG if we would like to step down as organizers. It&rsquo;s really hard to achieve that but that&rsquo;s the goal. I would like also to have smaller meetups (the current situation is a bit too much) and more local developers as speakers, especially from unrepresented minorities.</p>
<p>VigoJUG status is different. I can&rsquo;t travel to Vigo each month and find speakers is quite complicated. We are trying to do a meetup every two months so the JUG can survive in low-maintenance mode. It&rsquo;s fine for now, the situation could improve in the future if some volunteer appears.</p>
<p>No news from VigoTech, the community seems a bit blocked now and I can&rsquo;t help from Coruña. I almost abandoned the idea of CoruñaTech, we need a more diverse group in Coruña to have something like that. Luckily, new groups and individuals are starting and I&rsquo;m quite positive.</p>
<p>I also abandoned the idea of XantarJ, there are too many conferences and I don&rsquo;t feel motivated enough to work so much. Organize a conference is a big effort and I&rsquo;m the type of person who wants to do it great or not do it at all. I&rsquo;m not sure about &ldquo;La Atlántica&rdquo;. It was a great experience last year but I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable collaborating with conferences which aren&rsquo;t 100% technical. I don&rsquo;t have anything against entrepreneurship, privacy, agile or recruiting but they are just not what motivates me.</p>
<p>I plan to attend some conferences this year as speaker or attendee: GReach, J on the Beach, Kafka Summit, JNation, JBCNConf, Lambda World, Spark Summit, etc. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m going to attend all of them, it&rsquo;s a bit too much but I will try to attend as many as possible. It&rsquo;s always great to meet those communities!</p>
<p>In a more personal sense, last year I started to participate in a French reading club. I did a great effort to learn French and I don&rsquo;t want to lose it. It has been a great activity! As another goal for 2020, I will try to read all the club books (one per month), plus twelve technical books (six about programming, six about data engineering) and another six in Galician (another reading club I found in Goodreads). Read is one of the things I&rsquo;m enjoying more nowadays.</p>
<p>In contrast, I&rsquo;m doing a lot less sport. My goal is to visit the gym two days per week. I never liked the gym but there are some interesting activities and it&rsquo;s only 45 minutes at the lunchtime. Once I have more time, I will try to increase the number of days. By now, I&rsquo;m just in surviving-mode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy with how things are going with my kids. We find a suitable way so my goal is to continue with them in the same way.</p>
<p>I know some personal challenges will come in the middle of the summer including resume the rebuilding of our future house&hellip; so I don&rsquo;t have more goals for 2020. This year goal is to survive, build the basis and wait for better times to start new projects.</p>
