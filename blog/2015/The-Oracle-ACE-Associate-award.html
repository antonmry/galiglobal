		<h1>The Oracle ACE Associate award</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>16 June 2015</em></p>

	<p><p>In the beginning of the year, I've been awarded as <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=19297:4:::NO:4:P4_ID:12240">Oracle ACE Associate</a>. It was the first time I've earned something like that so I'm very proud and happy. It's not a secret I've been working with Oracle Comms since 2007 but it wasn't until last year I started to be more active in social networks, writing articles and attending conferences. I should have started to do it sooner but it's not so easy, and it isn't until now I really know my desired professional path.</p>
<p><img src="/images/About-me/O_ACE_Icon_blk.png" alt="Oracle ACE Associate" /></p>
<p>Let me explain the different reasons because this award is important to me.</p>
<h2>Optare Solutions</h2>
<p>Optare is a great company full of potential ACEs. I remember RittmanMead (a similar company in the BI space) and how <a href="http://www.rittmanmead.com/2014/12/six-months-an-ace/">they promote their workers to became Oracle ACE and participate in technical conferences</a>. I know how important is this type of activities. Things like that provide a more clear professional path, increase the visibility of the company (hey! They have 5 Orace ACE and 1 Oracle ACE Director) and, even more important, it helps to identify and retain talented people. I am the first Oracle ACE Associate in Optare. I hope this is only the beginning. There are really good Oracle consultants and developers in the company, so the most important thing (the know-how) is not going to be the problem.</p>
<h2>Oracle Communications</h2>
<p>Even if Oracle Comms is quite big after the adquisitions of ACME and Tekelec, the OTN community is quite inactive. For example, the last OTN article published <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/communications/index.html">here</a> it was in 2005, and not, the solution isn't close the section!. I would like to see a more active community and that was the reason of my Oracle ACE Associate submission. I know it's a big task and it's impossible to achieve it alone but there are some people inside Oracle working in this direction and I am quite positive. A probe of that is the <a href="http://www.tadhack.com">TADHack</a> and the <a href="http://tadhack.optaresolutions.com/">Oracle Sandbox</a> promoted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Doug_Tait">Douglas Tait</a>, he's doing a great job building a developers community. I am sure we'll see important updates in the following months.</p>
<h2>Myself</h2>
<p>Everyone likes to receive awards and I am not different. But more important, it's a good sign about how I am doing things right now. In the end of 2012, I left Accenture and my work as Project Manager. I returned to Optare Solutions and it's a decision I don't regret. But I've to paid the fee: stop my career as manager and back to be a technical guy. Being an IT worker in Spain is never more a professional suicide. There are some cool companies as Optare Solutions and Quobis, or you can work remotely for foreign companies. All you have to do is to be a good engineer and speak English well. That's the reason because Oracle ACE Associate is important to me: it probes both.</p>
<p>Other important point, Oracle ACE Associate gives me access to some cool resources and the possibility to speak in technical conferences. I really appreciate that right now. And, of course, I have some cool Oracle stuff now :-)</p>

<p>I can not end this blog post without mention <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/pub/miguel-garcia-lorenzo/33/69b/63a/en">Miguel Garcia</a>. He was the guy who has nominated me for the award. It's an honor to be nominated for someone so good and experienced as Miguel. Thanks!</p>
