# About me

I'm a data infrastructure engineer who gets a real kick out of building scalable data platforms that solve complex
problems. I've spent years diving deep into Kafka, Flink, and Java, along with all the cloud tools we use to make these
systems hum. I love tackling big challenges - like building reliable and scalable distributed systems that handle
massive data volumes or optimizing performance to reduce cloud costs and minimize environmental impact- and I thrive on
collaborating with smart teams to bring those solutions to life. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging data to
drive positive impact in environmental sustainability.
