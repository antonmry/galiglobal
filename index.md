# About me

My name is Anton Rodriguez. I live in the middle of the [Coast of Death] in the
north-west corner of Spain surrounded by greenhouses and cow farms. The
[end of the world] is literally less than 1 hour away from my house. I live in
such a unusual place because my kids love it, and I love my kids. When I'm not
with them (or working), I enjoy practicing sports (mostly, running and strength
training these days) and reading books.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer specializing in building and operating robust,
scalable data systems. My current focus is on performance optimization using the
Rust ecosystem (Apache Arrow, Datafusion and Ballista), algorithm optimization
and continuous profiling with eBPF.

For over seven years, I've specialized in Apache Kafka and Apache Flink within
multi-cloud (AWS, GCP) environments, managing data flows upwards of 150GB/s and
3 million messages/sec. This experience has given me deep insights into
designing, deploying, and debugging distributed systems in production,
emphasizing reliability, observability, and security best practices.

I thrive on:

- Owning the tooling for data pipeline lifecycle management, system
  orchestration, performance and diagnostics.
- Collaborating across teams (compiler, engine, connectors) to bridge product
  features into usable, resilient deployments.
- Hardening Kubernetes-based deployments (Docker, Helm) for enterprise-grade
  reliability.
- Designing and implementing interfaces (CLI, APIs, Helm charts) that simplify
  deployment and scaling.

A [Java Champion] and [Google Developer Expert] (Cloud), I'm focused on Rust now
and bring extensive experience with the JVM ecosystem (Java, Scala, Groovy). You
can find more about me in [my blog].

My social media activity is limited to [BlueSky] and [GitHub]. Feel free to ping
me there; I'm always happy to engage in meaningful conversations about
technology and career development.
