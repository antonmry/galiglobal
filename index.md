# About me

My name is Anton Rodriguez. I live in the middle of the [Coast of Death] in the north-west corner of Spain surrounded by
greenhouses and cow farms. The [end of the world] is literally less than 1 hour away from my house. I live in such a
unusual place because my kids love it, and I love my kids. When I'm not with them (or working), I enjoy
practicing sports (mostly, running and [padel tennis] these days) and reading books.

I'm very passionate about technology since I was 8 years old and I started coding in a MSX computer. While titles aren't
my primary focus, I usually define myself as Senior Data Infrastructure Engineer for the following reasons:

- **Senior**: I've been working in the tech industry enough to appreciate ["boring technology"].
- **Data**: at scale. Anything over 150GB/s and 3 million of Kafka messages per second gets me interested.
- **Infrastructure**: I prefer the "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" book over "Domain-Driven Design" but I like
  coding, in particular debugging and performance optimizations.
- **Engineer**: specifically, a [1x engineer] who leverages his impact [through others to create ten times the influence that they could have exerted on their own](https://www.billeager.com/the-true-10x-engineer/).

In terms of technologies, I'm a big fan of the JVM ecosystem and a [Java Champion]. I've always liked to learn other
languages (Groovy, Scala, Go) and these days I'm having fun with Rust. I have a strong background in distributed systems
and, in particular, with Apache Kafka and Apache Flink for the last 5 years. I've been working with cloud technologies
across all the major providers. I was named a [Google Developer Expert] in 2021.

My social media activity is limited to [BlueSky] and [GitHub]. Feel free to ping me there; I'm always happy to engage in
meaningful conversations about technology and career development.
