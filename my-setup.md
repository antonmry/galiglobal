# My setup

I've always spent a lot of time setting up my development environment. When I was 10 years old, I spent one year setting
linux in my home computer. We didn't have internet, so I had to learn everything by myself. I remember that the X server
setup was particularly hard. After that, I spent way too much recompiling the Linux kernet to make my laptop more
performant. It was a lot of fun and, somehow, I still enjoy doing it.

My current setup isn't particularly good, and I'm pretty sure it's not particularly reusable for others. But I wanted
to document it anyway. Maybe it's inspiring for someone.

## Aesthetics

- Always use a light theme for everything. I can't stand dark themes.
- I like to use a monospace font for everything. I
  use [ComicShannsMono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/ComicShannsMono). It's based
  in Comic Sans, weird, I know, but I find it very readable and that's what matter to me.
- Simplicity is key. I don't like cluttered interfaces. I don't use menus, toolbars, or anything that takes space on
  the screen.
- Shortcuts are mandatory. I try to use the keyboard as much as possible. I don't like to use the mouse.
- I disable notifications for almost everything, both in my phone and in my computer.

As you can see, my website follows the same principles.

## Hardware

Nothing special here. I have a M1 macbook because that's what my employer gave me. I would prefer to use a linux
laptop. I had a pretty good experience in the past with a Slimbook and a Dell XPS Developer Edition. I only use a
screen, a Dell UltraSharp 34. I'm still trying to get used to such a big screen. I like mechanical keyboards,
but I don't use anything special: a Logitech Pop with the Spanish layout.

## Operating System

My favourite operating system is Fedora with the i3 window manager. I've been using it for years. Unfortunately, I
can't use it in my work laptop. I spent way too much time trying to use MacOs in a way that is similar and, in some
aspects, I think I've succeeded. Animations are disabled, the bar is hidden, etc.

I spend the 98% of my time in 5 different applications: the browser, the terminal, the IDE, Slack and Zoom. That's all.
So those applications are always open in full screen mode and I switch between them using the keyboard. For example,
Command+1 takes me to the browser, Command+2 to the terminal, etc. I'm so used to this that I can't use a computer
without this setup.

I use [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) to launch applications. I don't even know how launch an
application in the Mac without Raycast. I like to have some scripts to manage hardware, like the screen brightness,
volume, lights, etc.

## Browser

I'm using [Zen browser](https://zen-browser.app/) these days. It's based on Firefox. It allows me to use a couple of
extensions that are mandatory for me: [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) and uBlock Origin. I don't have a strong
preference for a browser.

## Terminal and shell

In the past I used Alacrity, but I'm using WezTerm now and I love it. There are three important things for me:

- I don't want to see anything except the $.
- I want to configure everything with a single file.
- I need to be able to switch the command and the control keys only for the terminal (MacOS is configured to do it for
  all the other apps but that change breaks the shortcuts in the terminal).

In addition, WezTerm will allow me to remove Tmux from my setup, that's still in my TODO list, though. I use Tmux a lot
with a particular workflow: I usually have multiple windows and I rename them (Ctrl+b+,). Then, when I want to switch to
a window, I use Ctrl+b+' and type the first letters of the name. This works very well for me because I never use tabs,
so I can easily switch between windows and I don't care about the order of them.
