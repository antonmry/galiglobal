# My setup

I've always spent a lot of time setting up my development environment. When I was 10 years old, I spent one year setting
linux in my home computer. We didn't have internet, so I had to learn everything by myself. I remember that the X server
setup was particularly hard. After that, I spent way too much recompiling the Linux kernet to make my laptop more
performant. It was a lot of fun and, somehow, I still enjoy doing it.

My current setup isn't particularly good, and I'm pretty sure it's not particularly reusable for others. But I wanted
to document it anyway. Maybe it's inspiring for someone.

## Aesthetics

- Always use a light theme for everything. I can't stand dark themes.
- Simplicity is key. I don't like cluttered interfaces. I don't use menues, toolbars, or anything that takes space on
  the screen.
- Shortcuts are mandatory. I try to use the keyboard as much as possible. I don't like to use the mouse.
